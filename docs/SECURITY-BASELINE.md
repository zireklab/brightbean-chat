# BrightBean Chat — Security Baseline

This is the per-PR security checklist for every implementation issue. **Every PR must satisfy the applicable items below**; reviewers verify them, CI enforces the automatable ones, and a security review runs over each layer's merged diff at the layer gate (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` → Execution model). The final Layer-7 security pass (issue #29) verifies traceability: every item here maps to at least one test.

Threat model in one paragraph: a self-hosted deployment exposes webhook endpoints and public token routes to the internet from day one; message content, usernames, comment bodies, and media URLs arrive from **strangers** (attacker-controlled); users author automations that make server-side HTTP requests; multiple workspaces share one database; the encrypted platform credentials are the crown jewels.

## 1. Tenancy isolation
- Every queryset on tenant data goes through the workspace-scoped base manager (from L1-A). No `.objects.all()` on tenant models in views/APIs.
- Cross-workspace access to any object returns **404** (never 403 — no existence oracle).
- Any PR that adds views or API endpoints must extend the IDOR fuzz suite (helper from L1-A): every new endpoint is hit as an authenticated user of a *different* workspace and must 404.

## 2. Untrusted inbound content
- All platform-delivered content — message text, usernames, profile fields, comment bodies, attachment/media URLs — is attacker-controlled. Escape on render, never `mark_safe`, never render platform-supplied HTML raw.
- Webhook payload parsing is defensive: type-check every field, tolerate missing/extra keys, cap sizes. Fixture suites must include malformed and hostile payloads (oversized, wrong types, script/injection strings in every string field).

## 3. Templating (SSTI ban)
- `{{placeholder}}` rendering is **plain token substitution** via the one shared renderer (lives in the flow engine, `flows/rendering.py`). User- or contact-supplied content is **never** evaluated by Django/Jinja template engines.
- In HTML contexts (email bodies), substituted values are HTML-escaped; elsewhere plain text. Variables sourced from External Request responses are untrusted like contact input.

## 4. Public token routes
- All unauthenticated token routes — unsubscribe `/u/`, media delivery `/m/`, click `/c/`, pixel `/o/`, flow-preview links, `/internal/tick` — use the one shared signing utility (Django signer, versioned payloads, expiry where the use case allows).
- Verification is constant-time; any failure returns a generic 404 (no error detail, no timing oracle).
- **Two documented divergences**, each argued where it lives and named here so the checklist does not read as unmet. `/internal/tick` uses a bare env token compared with `constant_time_compare` (`apps/queueing/views.py`): a third-party pinger stores one URL forever, so `max_age=None` would make a signed token "a bare token with extra steps". Telegram flow-preview links use a stored HMAC digest of a random handle (`apps/channels/models.py`), because Telegram caps a `start` payload at 64 characters, which a signed payload does not fit. Both keep the properties that matter — constant-time compare, bare 404, no oracle.
- A token route's path prefix goes in `apps/common/logging.py`'s `_TOKEN_PATH_PREFIXES` so the credential is scrubbed out of request lines. `tests/test_token_routes.py` derives the list from the URL conf and fails when a route is missing from it.

## 5. Secrets
- Credentials and tokens are stored only in encrypted fields (AES-256-GCM util from L1-A). Never in plain columns, fixtures, or logs.
- The global log-scrubbing filter (L1-A) is installed in all environments; tests assert tokens never appear in captured logs, error reports, admin list displays, or API responses.

## 6. Outbound HTTP (SSRF)
- Any server-initiated request to a user-supplied or contact-supplied URL goes through the SSRF guard — `apps.common.outbound.guarded_request`, landed by issue #15 — for the External Request node, outbound webhook deliveries, media fetch-by-URL and provider callbacks. No exceptions; new call sites add a test proving the guard is in the path.
- "Proving" means `tests/ssrf.py`'s `guard_required()`, which fails any HTTP request made inside its block that did not come from the guard. Asserting that a patched `guarded_request` was called is not the same claim: it stays green when a second, unguarded request is made beside it.
- The guard denies loopback, link-local (cloud metadata), multicast, reserved and unspecified addresses and the deployment's own host, resolves before connecting, **pins the resolved address** so DNS cannot rebind between the check and the connect, re-validates every redirect (cap 3), allows only `http`/`https`, and caps the response body with a streaming cutoff — requesting `Accept-Encoding: identity` and declining to expand a body compressed anyway, since a cap on a decompressed stream fires only after the allocation it exists to prevent. `EXTERNAL_REQUEST_ALLOW_PRIVATE` relaxes the private-range rule alone, for on-prem deployments; it opens nothing else.
- `apps.channels.providers.base.request_json` is the sibling for URLs an adapter builds from constants and stored ids. A call site that cannot tell which of the two it is wants the guard.
- **Two paths reach the network without passing either**, because neither is HTTP-over-httpx: Django's SMTP backend to a workspace-configured host, and boto3 to SES (both in `apps/channels/providers/email_backends.py`). SMTP applies the guard's own address rules as a pre-flight (`refusal_for`/`resolve_host`) but does not pin the connection; boto3 owns its transport entirely. `tests/test_ssrf_call_sites.py` counts the doors and pins this exception so a third cannot appear quietly.

## 7. Input limits
- Request body-size caps on every webhook and public endpoint, enforced before signature work where possible and always before DB writes.
- JSON documents authored by users (`graph_json`, `filter_json`, `config_json`, import files) get size + depth caps and schema validation that **rejects unknown keys** (mass-assignment guard).
- Set-wise condition evaluation compiles through the ORM only, with a field/operator allowlist — no string-built SQL anywhere.

## 8. Web platform hardening
- CSP with per-request nonces (Studio pattern) on every page, including the React builder island.
- Session/CSRF cookies `Secure`, `HttpOnly` (session), `SameSite=Lax`; CSRF enforced on all session-authenticated endpoints including the builder data API.
- Auth endpoints (login, signup, password reset) rate-limited; responses enumeration-safe.
- Production settings refuse to boot without `SECRET_KEY` + `ENCRYPTION_KEY_SALT`; `DEBUG` off outside dev; security headers (HSTS with preload and subdomains, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, frame-deny, referrer-policy) set in **both** places and verified by `scripts/smoke.sh`: `config/settings/production.py` sets them on the application's own responses, and `deploy/Caddyfile` sets them at the edge (issue #28). Two enforcement points rather than one is deliberate — a self-hoster who terminates TLS somewhere other than the reference proxy still gets them from the app, and `SECURITY.md` puts a missing header on a replaced proxy out of scope for exactly that reason.
- `form-action` is `'self'` plus an exact allowlist of the OAuth origins the application navigates to (`OAUTH_FORM_ACTION` in `config/settings/base.py`). Chrome and Safari check the directive against every hop of the navigation a form submission starts, against the policy of the page that held the form, so a flow that POSTs to itself and answers a redirect to a provider is blocked outright without its origin listed — issue #115, which is how the Messenger connect button came to do nothing. Firefox does not check redirects and the specification question is still open (w3c/webappsec-csp#8); two engines out of three is the behaviour to be correct against. Each entry widens the directive, so an entry is as wide as the provider's own redirects and no wider — a provider that bounces its dialog between its own subdomains puts that bounce inside the same navigation, so several entries are a domain rather than one host. `tests/form_action.py` holds the inventory and the argument for each entry; the sweep over it fails both on an origin that no longer matches the code that navigates there and on one that is not in the inventory at all, and the Stripe entries are tested against the same rule `apps/billing/services._stripe_url` applies, because a URL that function passes and the policy refuses is a redirect the browser drops in silence.

## 9. File uploads (media library)
- Content-type determined by sniffing, not extension. SVG/HTML/unknown types are served with `Content-Disposition: attachment` + `nosniff` (stored-XSS ban); only safe image types render inline.
- Per-file and per-workspace size quotas. Delivery URLs signed and unguessable.

## 10. Supply chain
- Python dependencies pinned to exact versions in `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt`. These pin **direct** dependencies only: the transitive tree is resolved at install time and is not hash-verified, so a build is reproducible in what it asks for, not in every artefact it receives. `package-lock.json` locks the JavaScript tree in full. `pip-audit` and `npm audit` run in CI (build fails on known-vulnerable deps without a documented waiver); Dependabot enabled; Bandit (or ruff security rules) in lint.

## 11. Gate policy
- **Per PR**: applicable checklist items above + tests. Security-critical issues (webhook framework #4, External Request #15, media library #16, public API #25, and every channel adapter) additionally get a dedicated security review at PR time.
- **Per layer gate**: security review over the layer's merged diff, IDOR fuzz suite green, dependency audits clean (or waivers documented in the PR).
- **Traceability**: [`docs/security-audit.md`](security-audit.md) maps every bullet above, and every SPEC §19 bullet, to the test that enforces it. `tests/test_security_audit.py` fails when a bullet is added here without being mapped, or when a mapped test stops existing.
