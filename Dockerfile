# see scripts/vendor-js.mjs for why.

# Lockfile first, so a source-only change reuses the install layer.
#
# .npmrc comes along because it carries engine-strict=true, which is what turns
# a Node version this project does not support into a failed install rather
# than an EBADENGINE warning. It has to arrive here and not with the `COPY . .`
# below, which runs after npm ci and so would leave the build unguarded.

# Only what styles.css actually reads: its own source, and the trees its
# @source directives scan. `COPY . .` here meant an edit to a setting, a test or
# any other file invalidated the CSS build and every layer after it, for a
# bundle that could not possibly have changed.
#
# These paths must track the @source directives in
# theme/static_src/src/styles.css. TestTailwindSourceCoverage in
# apps/common/tests/test_shell.py fails if a template appears somewhere this
# stage does not copy, so the two cannot drift apart silently.
#
# frontend/builder/ is one of those globs — the island's class names live in
# TSX — and it is also the input to the build:js below, so it arrives once and
# serves both.

# stylesheet change does not rebuild the bundle and vice versa.
#
# It inlines static/flows/flow-schema.json, which is committed, so this needs no
# Python. Both outputs are asserted because
# apps/flows/templatetags/flow_builder.py deliberately renders a notice rather
# than raising when one is missing — right for a running app, exactly wrong for
# a release build, which should never get that far. `builder.css` is also the
# tripwire for the asset filename drifting, and the single-file check for a
# Rollup chunk appearing: collectstatic does not rewrite ES-module specifiers,
# so a second chunk would lose its cache-busting silently.
