## About BrightBean Chat

BrightBean Chat is an open-source, self-hostable chat-marketing automation
platform, a ManyChat alternative you run on your own infrastructure. Connect
the messaging channels your audience already uses, build automation in a visual
flow editor, and manage contacts, conversations, and campaigns from one
workspace.

It is designed for creators, agencies, and teams that want to own their
messaging stack rather than put customer conversations behind another SaaS
vendor. The application calls each platform's official API directly using your
credentials. There is no aggregator middleman, per-seat pricing, or required
payment provider.

Every self-hosted installation has one tier. All features are available, with
no feature gates or contact limits.

> **Status: pre-1.0.** The core platform is in place: tenancy and RBAC, all six
> channel adapters, the flow engine and builder, contacts, the inbox,
> sequences, broadcasts, analytics, the media library, and the public API.
> Remaining work is tracked in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md). Read
> [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) before pointing a real audience at it.

## An open-source ManyChat alternative

BrightBean Chat aims at ManyChat's feature set: keyword triggers,
comment-to-DM, story mentions, drip sequences, broadcasts, a shared inbox, and a
visual flow builder. The difference is where it runs. You bring your own server
and your own platform developer apps, and in exchange there is no per-contact
pricing, no plan that gates the feature you need, and no third party sitting
between you and your audience.

| | ManyChat | BrightBean Chat |
|---|---|---|
| **Hosting** | Managed SaaS | Self-hosted: Docker Compose on your own server, or one-click on Railway |
| **Pricing** | Per-contact tiers, with features gated by plan | One tier, every feature, no contact limits. Your only cost is the server |
| **Your data** | Lives in ManyChat's account | Your PostgreSQL and your object storage |
| **Platform access** | Through ManyChat's Meta app | Your own Meta, Twilio, and SMTP credentials, called directly. No aggregator |
| **Source** | Proprietary | AGPL-3.0, so you can read it, change it, and run your fork |
| **Extensibility** | Catalog of native integrations | Public REST API, signed outbound webhooks, and the External Request node |
| **Channels** | Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, email, TikTok | The same, minus TikTok, whose DM API is restricted to badged partners |
| **AI features** | Built-in reply generation and intent detection | None, deliberately ([`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) §1.1) |

Self-hosting has costs ManyChat absorbs for you. ManyChat keeps the service
running, and its Meta app is already approved. Running this yourself means
creating your own Meta developer app, passing app review for the permissions
each channel needs, and owning uptime, upgrades, and backups. If that is not a
trade you want to make, ManyChat is the better product for you.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multi-channel automation** | One normalized event pipeline for Telegram, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, and email. |
| **Visual flow builder** | Versioned React Flow graphs with conditions, delays, randomizers, nested flows, external requests, data collection, actions, SMS, and email nodes. |
| **Triggers** | Keywords, default replies, story mentions and replies, comment-to-DM, follows, ref URLs and QR codes, inbox rules, and the public API. |
| **Shared inbox** | Threaded conversations with assignment, labels, reminders, scheduled replies, inbox rules, and human takeover that pauses automation. |
| **Contacts** | Custom fields, tags, segments, cross-channel identities, import, and export. |
| **Sequences & broadcasts** | Multi-step drip campaigns, audience filters, compliance checks, token-bucket pacing, live counters, and cancellation. |
| **Analytics** | Per-node sent, delivered, failed, and clicked counters, plus flow and broadcast statistics. |
| **Public API** | Bearer-authenticated REST endpoints and signed outbound webhooks for Make, Zapier, n8n, and custom integrations. |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Organizations, workspaces, invitations, two-tier RBAC, and enforced tenant isolation. Cross-tenant object access answers 404. |
| **Secure by default** | Encrypted credentials at rest, SSRF protection for user-supplied URLs, CSP nonces, webhook signature checks, opt-out enforcement, and production settings that reject placeholder secrets. |

Deliberately out of scope for v1: AI reply generation, TikTok DM automation,
native mobile apps, e-commerce, website growth widgets, and built-in third-party
CRM/Zapier-style connectors. The integration surface is the public API,
outbound webhooks, and the External Request flow node
([`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) §1.1).

## Supported channels

Every channel uses the same flow and compliance engine. Unsupported message
blocks are downgraded visibly where possible, and platform-specific rules are
checked before every send.

| Channel | Inbound | Outbound | Important behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Telegram** | Messages, button presses, and `/start` referrals | Text, images, audio, video, files, buttons, and quick replies | No messaging window; contacts must have opted in by messaging the bot. |
| **Instagram** | DMs, comments, story mentions, and story replies | Text, media, cards, galleries, buttons, and quick replies | 24-hour messaging window; comment-to-DM supports one private reply per comment within seven days; no broadcasts. |
| **Facebook Messenger** | DMs, postbacks, referrals, and Page comments | Text, media, cards, galleries, buttons, and quick replies | 24-hour window; approved message tags support permitted outside-window sends and broadcasts. |
| **WhatsApp** | Messages and delivery/read status updates | Text, media, buttons, quick replies, and approved templates | 24-hour window; approved templates are required outside it. Template management is built in. |
| **SMS** | Inbound texts and carrier opt-out keywords | SMS and outbound MMS images | Bring your own Twilio account. STOP/HELP/START handling and GSM-7/UCS-2 segment previews are built in. |
| **Email** | Provider bounce notifications only (not conversations) | HTML and plain-text email, inline images, unsubscribe links, and tracked links | Bring your own SMTP, Resend, or SES credentials. Unsubscribe and hard-bounce suppression are enforced. |

Meta's platforms need a developer app of your own, set as environment
variables. See [Platform credentials](#platform-credentials). Per-channel
webhook URLs, permissions, and platform quirks are in
[`docs/channels/`](docs/channels/).

## Try it locally

The fastest way to see the flow builder, inbox, contacts, and campaign surfaces
is to run the complete development stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-chat.git
cd brightbean-chat
docker compose up
```

Docker builds the image, starts PostgreSQL, runs migrations, and serves the app
at <http://localhost:8000>. No `.env` is required for development. Sign up at
`/accounts/signup/`; the first account gets its own organization and workspace.
Email is written to the console, so verification messages are visible in
`docker compose logs`.

The design system's living style guide is available at
<http://localhost:8000/ui/> on a running instance.

## Deploy it

The full [self-hosting guide](docs/self-hosting.md) covers first boot, TLS,
backups, upgrades, storage, tick mode, and hardening. The reference production
stack is Docker Compose and is secure by default: no placeholder secrets,
`DEBUG` off, PostgreSQL closed to the internet, and only Caddy exposed publicly.

### Docker Compose on a VPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightbeanxyz/brightbean-chat.git
cd brightbean-chat
cp deploy/env.prod.example .env
make prod-secrets
```

Fill in `APP_DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY_SALT`, and
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, then start the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
make smoke URL=https://your-host.example
```

The stack runs PostgreSQL, a one-shot migration, the Gunicorn web process, the
background worker, and Caddy with automatic HTTPS. Uploaded media is stored in
the shared Docker volume. See [storage guidance](docs/self-hosting.md#storage-when-web-and-worker-are-separate)
when web and worker run on separate hosts or a PaaS.

### One click on Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/brightbean-chat?referralCode=niwfCQ&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

The template provisions PostgreSQL, the web service, and the worker, generates
the two crypto secrets once and shares them, and points the app at its own
generated domain. You supply one thing: an S3-compatible bucket.

That bucket is not optional. A Railway volume attaches to a single service, so
the web and worker processes share no filesystem — without `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`
a queued contact import cannot find the file the web process wrote, and
uploaded media disappears on the next restart. AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze
B2, and MinIO all work through the same five `S3_*` variables. The
[Railway guide](docs/self-hosting.md#railway) has a worked R2 example and the
manual three-service setup if you would rather build it yourself.

### The worker is required

The web process handles pages, the API, and inbound webhooks. The worker runs
everything time-based from the PostgreSQL queue:

- smart delays, retries, and crash recovery;
- sequence steps and broadcast fanout; and
- hourly housekeeping such as token refresh, stale-execution expiry, and log pruning.

A deployment with only the web process looks healthy but silently leaves queued
work undone. If your host cannot run a second long-lived process, the supported
[tick mode](docs/self-hosting.md#running-without-a-worker-tick-mode) provides a
cron or HTTP-triggered worker cycle with documented tradeoffs.

## Run it locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 24+
- PostgreSQL 16

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make setup
```

`make setup` copies `.env.example`, installs the development dependencies,
builds the frontend bundles, and runs migrations. Then use two
terminals:

```bash
make server
```

```bash
make worker
```

The frontend uses Tailwind 4 and a single React 19 flow-builder island. During
development, run `make css-watch` and `make js-watch` alongside the server when
you need live CSS or builder bundle rebuilds. `make help` lists every available
target.

## Platform credentials

Connecting Instagram, Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp needs a Meta developer app
of your own. BrightBean Chat calls each platform's API directly with your
credentials, so there is no shared app to borrow and nothing to register with
us.

These are developer credentials, and they are set as environment variables.
They belong in the deployment's `.env` beside `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`,
not in a settings page. No workspace admin should be able to change which Meta
app the deployment speaks as.

A deployment serving several organizations from one instance can give each its
own Meta app id and secret instead, from the Django admin at
`https://<your-host>/admin/` → *Credentials → Platform credentials*. That page
is superuser-only (`python manage.py createsuperuser`). The environment wins.
When a platform is configured in both places, the environment value is the one
in force and the admin row is never consulted. It is the fallback for
organizations that have none, not an override.

`PLATFORM_<PLATFORM>_VERIFY_TOKEN` is always deployment-level and must be set
in the environment, including when the app id and secret come from an
organization row. Meta's verification `GET` arrives at `/webhooks/<platform>/`
unauthenticated, carrying nothing but the platform name. There is no
organization to resolve a token against, so the endpoint reads only the
environment. Leave it unset and that platform's verification answers 404, which
means the webhook cannot be subscribed and no inbound events arrive at all.

A level is used only when it is *complete*. Setting a secret without its id
leaves that platform unconfigured rather than half-configured, because a
half-filled app produces a 401 from Meta that names neither value.

Telegram, SMS, and email have no deployment-level credentials: a bot token comes
from BotFather, Twilio ships an account SID, and SMTP logins are per sending
domain. All three live on the individual channel connection.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID` | For Instagram | Instagram app ID, from the Meta app's *Instagram* product |
| `PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Instagram | Instagram app secret. Neither value works without the other |
| `PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_VERIFY_TOKEN` | For Instagram | Any long random string you choose, pasted into Meta's *Verify token* field. Unset means the verification `GET` answers 404, so nothing can be subscribed by accident |
| `PLATFORM_MESSENGER_CLIENT_ID` | For Messenger | Facebook app ID, from *App settings → Basic* |
| `PLATFORM_MESSENGER_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Messenger | Facebook app secret |
| `PLATFORM_MESSENGER_VERIFY_TOKEN` | For Messenger | As above, for the Messenger webhook |
| `PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_CLIENT_ID` | For WhatsApp | Meta app ID that owns the WhatsApp Business account |
| `PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_CLIENT_SECRET` | For WhatsApp | Meta app secret. This is what verifies every inbound delivery's signature, so it is required even though the WhatsApp setup never runs OAuth |
| `PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` | For WhatsApp | As above, for the WhatsApp webhook |

Meta's console labels these *App ID* and *App Secret*;
`PLATFORM_<PLATFORM>_APP_ID` and `_APP_SECRET` are accepted as aliases of the
OAuth spelling used above. The full variable reference is
[`.env.example`](.env.example), and each channel's permissions, sending rules,
and platform quirks are in [`docs/channels/`](docs/channels/).

### Instagram

Instagram runs on the Instagram API with Instagram Login, against
professional accounts, either Business or Creator. No Facebook Page in the
middle.

1. At [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/), create an
   app and add the **Instagram** product.
2. Under *Instagram → Business login settings*, add this deployment's redirect
   URI, exactly as written:

   ```
   https://<your-host>/channels/instagram/callback/
   ```

   One URI for the whole deployment, not one per workspace. Meta matches it
   character for character, and the workspace travels in a signed `state`.
3. In the App Dashboard, go to *Instagram → Permissions and features* and add
   the permissions this deployment requests:

   **Use case: "Instagram API"** (the *Instagram API with Instagram Login*
   setup from step 1)
   - Add these permissions: `instagram_business_basic` (the account's id and
     username, which everything else is built on),
     `instagram_business_manage_messages` (reading and sending DMs, story
     replies, and story mentions), `instagram_business_manage_comments`
     (reading comments and posting public replies — the comment trigger)

   All three are requested at connect time rather than incrementally.
   Connecting without `manage_comments` succeeds and then fails every public
   reply, which is a worse thing to discover later.
4. Copy the *Instagram app ID* and *Instagram app secret* from the Instagram
   product's API setup. These are not the plain Facebook app id and secret.
5. Set:

   ```dotenv
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=...
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_VERIFY_TOKEN=...
   ```
6. Under *Instagram → Webhooks*, set the callback URL to
   `https://<your-host>/webhooks/instagram/` and the verify token to the value
   above, then subscribe to `messages`, `messaging_postbacks`, `comments`,
   `mentions`, and `message_deletions`.

Serving any account other than the app owner's own needs Advanced Access, App
Review, and Business Verification, the step that takes weeks rather than
minutes. See [`docs/channels/instagram.md`](docs/channels/instagram.md).

### Facebook Messenger

1. At [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/), create an
   app of type **Business** and add two products: **Messenger** and **Facebook
   Login for Business**.
2. Under *Facebook Login for Business → Settings → Valid OAuth Redirect URIs*,
   add this deployment's callback, exactly as written:

   ```
   https://<your-host>/channels/messenger/callback/
   ```
3. In the App Dashboard, go to **Use cases** and add the two use cases below.
   Click into each one and go to **Permissions and features** to add the
   optional permissions:

   **Use case: "Messenger from Meta"**
   - Required to enable `pages_messaging`, which is not available under the
     Page use case
   - Add the optional permission: `pages_messaging` — sending and receiving
     DMs, the channel itself

   **Use case: "Manage everything on your Page"**
   - Auto-includes `pages_show_list`, which is what makes `/me/accounts` return
     anything, so an operator can pick a page
   - Add these optional permissions: `pages_manage_metadata` (permits
     `subscribed_apps` and the Get Started button — without it a page
     connects and then silently never delivers), `pages_read_engagement`
     (read the comment that fires a comment trigger),
     `pages_manage_engagement` (post the public reply and the like)
4. Copy the app ID and app secret from *App settings → Basic*.
5. Set:

   ```dotenv
   PLATFORM_MESSENGER_CLIENT_ID=...
   PLATFORM_MESSENGER_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   PLATFORM_MESSENGER_VERIFY_TOKEN=...
   ```
6. Under *Messenger → Settings → Webhooks*, set the callback URL to
   `https://<your-host>/webhooks/messenger/` and the verify token to the value
   above. Pages are subscribed to `messages`, `messaging_postbacks`,
   `messaging_referrals`, `message_deliveries`, `message_reads`, and `feed`
   automatically when they connect.

This is the most expensive channel to set up: a Meta app, a page, App Review,
and Business Verification. See
[`docs/channels/messenger.md`](docs/channels/messenger.md).

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp does not use OAuth. You paste a system-user token into the connect
page rather than authorizing through Meta. The app secret is still required,
because it is what every inbound delivery's signature is verified against.

1. At [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/), create an
   app of type **Business** and add the **WhatsApp** product.
2. Add a phone number under *WhatsApp → API Setup* and complete its
   verification. Note the **phone number ID** (the numeric API id, not the
   phone number) and the **WhatsApp Business Account ID**.
3. Create a system user in *Business Settings*, give it access to the WABA, and
   generate a token carrying these permissions:

   **System user token** (there is no use case to add them under — WhatsApp
   runs no login dialog, so nobody is ever shown a consent screen)
   - Add these permissions: `whatsapp_business_messaging` (sending and
     receiving messages, the channel itself), `whatsapp_business_management`
     (reading the number back to prove the token, subscribing the WABA to
     webhooks, and managing templates)

   Choose **never expires**; a 60-day token becomes a silent outage two months
   after launch.
4. Copy the app ID and app secret from *App settings → Basic*.
5. Set:

   ```dotenv
   PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_CLIENT_ID=...
   PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   PLATFORM_WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=...
   ```
6. Under *WhatsApp → Configuration*, set the callback URL to
   `https://<your-host>/webhooks/whatsapp/` and the verify token to the value
   above.

Then finish in the app at *Settings → Channels → WhatsApp → set it up*, which
reads the number back from Meta to prove the token before storing anything. See
[`docs/channels/whatsapp.md`](docs/channels/whatsapp.md).

### What Meta has to approve

A new Meta app starts with **Standard Access**, which reaches only accounts
whose users hold a role on the app itself — the owner, and anyone added as a
developer or tester. That is enough to build against, and enough for a
self-hoster running their own accounts. Connecting an account belonging to
someone else means asking Meta for **Advanced Access** on each permission
through **App Review**, backed by **Business Verification** of the business
behind the app.

| Platform | Permissions to request | Also required |
|---|---|---|
| **Instagram** | `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_manage_messages`, `instagram_business_manage_comments` | App Review, submitted per permission with a screencast showing each one used end to end; Business Verification |
| **Facebook Messenger** | `pages_messaging`, plus `pages_read_engagement` and `pages_manage_engagement` if you use the comment trigger | Business Verification; a privacy policy URL and a data-deletion callback on the app |
| **WhatsApp** | `whatsapp_business_messaging`, `whatsapp_business_management`, on the system user token | No App Review — a system user token has no consent screen to review. Business Verification and message quality set the per-number messaging limit, and every template is approved individually |

Budget weeks rather than days, and expect at least one rejection asking for a
clearer screencast. This is Meta's process; nothing in this product changes it.

Telegram, SMS, and email have nothing to request. A BotFather token, a Twilio
account SID and auth token, and an SMTP or provider key are all issued on the
spot and reach every contact from the first message.

## API & webhooks

BrightBean Chat exposes a bearer-authenticated REST API at `/api/v1/` and
signed outbound webhooks for event-driven integrations. The deployment serves
an interactive reference at `/api/v1/docs` and OpenAPI JSON at
`/api/v1/openapi.json`.

Issue an API key from **Settings → Organization → API keys**, then send it as a
Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://chat.example.com/api/v1/contacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bb_..."
```

The API supports contacts, tags, custom fields, flow starts, messages, and
read-only lists of flows, tags, and fields. Requests are
workspace-scoped, rate-limited per key, and subject to the same compliance and
permission checks as the web UI. Outbound webhook deliveries use HMAC-SHA256,
retry through the worker, and automatically disable after repeated failures.

See the [API reference](docs/api/v1.md) for authentication, scopes, pagination,
errors, endpoints, webhook verification, and a complete integration scenario.

checks, dependency audits, and deployment-focused validation.

## Contributing

Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The project specification and
security baseline are part of the development workflow, not background reading.
New endpoints must be tenant-scoped, new URLs must follow the project routing
conventions, and security-sensitive behavior needs a regression test.

## Security

Please do not report vulnerabilities through public issues. Follow the process
in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), which explains the supported versions, scope,
safe-harbor terms, and what to include in a report.
