/**
 * The jsdom shims React Flow needs before it will render anything at all.
 *
 * Without them the canvas mounts at zero size and renders no nodes — and every
 * "is this node type placeable" assertion then passes against an empty
 * container. A vacuously green suite is worse than a red one here, because it
 * is checking an explicit acceptance criterion, so src/test/environment.test.tsx
 * renders a real <ReactFlow> and fails loudly if these shims stop working.
