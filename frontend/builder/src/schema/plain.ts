/**
 * Reader-facing names for node types.
 *
 * The registry's own `label` is developer copy — it names the mechanism
 * ("Send Message", "Smart Delay") and its `description` quotes SPEC sections.
 * That is right for the registry, which is read by the API, the exporter and
 * whoever is adding a node type. It is the wrong register for a canvas somebody
 * is reading to work out what their flow does.
 *
 * So a card now carries two lines: an eyebrow saying what KIND of step this is
 * in the reader's words ("Then send", "Then decide"), and the node's own
 * title underneath.
 *
 * ## Why this is keyed by group, not by type
 *
 * Because that is the axis the phrasing actually varies on, and the groups are
 * already data: `apps/flows/schema/nodes.py` assigns every type to one of
 * content / logic / actions / other, and those four are exactly the four
 * phrases the design draws. Keying by type would mean a new entry for every
 * node type ever added and a blank eyebrow the day somebody forgot one.
 *
 * ## Why TypeScript and not the Python registry
 *
 * Three reasons, in order of weight. The registry's labels are a different
 * register and should stay literal. A new field on `NodeSpec` changes the
 * committed artefact at `static/flows/flow-schema.json`, so a copy tweak would
 * mean `make schema`, a re-commit and a look at the export tests. And the
 * mapping is not 1:1 with types anyway — it is group-shaped, and the group is
 * already exported.
 *
 * `plain.test.ts` asserts every registered type and group resolves to a
 * non-empty phrase, so a group added in Python without copy here is a red build
 * rather than a blank line on a card.
