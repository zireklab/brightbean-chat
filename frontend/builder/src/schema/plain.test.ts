/**
 * The plain-language phrases stay in step with the registry.
 *
 * `plain.ts` lives here rather than on the Python `NodeSpec`, which buys a copy
 * tweak with no `make schema` and no artefact re-commit — and costs the risk of
 * the two drifting. These tests are that cost paid: they are generated from the
 * artefact, so a group registered in Python with no phrase here is a red build
 * naming the group, rather than a blank eyebrow nobody notices on a canvas.
