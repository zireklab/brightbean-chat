/**
 * The left column: what starts this flow, its steps, and the selected step's settings.
 *
 * This replaces the palette and the inspector, which were two panels either
 * side of the canvas doing one job between them — you picked a node type on the
 * left, it landed in the middle, and you configured it on the right, with your
 * eye crossing the window twice per step. Steps are added from the canvas now
 * (see AddStep), so the left column is the one place a step is read and edited.
 *
 * Three states, in order of what the reader needs:
 *
 * - **Nothing here yet** — no trigger and no steps. The column is the getting
 *   started path rather than an empty form.
 * - **Nothing selected** — the trigger, then the step list.
 * - **A step selected** — the trigger stays (it is the flow's first fact), then
 *   the step's own editor.

                eyebrow and title, in the same components, eight pixels beneath
                it — so the editor read as a seventh row that started counting
                again at one. "Editing step 4" is the whole fix: the number
                stops being a duplicate the moment something says it is the same
                step. The orange circle and the eyebrow go with it, because the
                caption now carries the identity and the row above still carries
                the kind.

                Sticky because the list answers "what am I editing?" only while
                the list is on screen, and a send_message form scrolls well past
                it. The title wraps rather than truncating: it is the thing
                being worked on, and it was being cut twice at two widths. */}
