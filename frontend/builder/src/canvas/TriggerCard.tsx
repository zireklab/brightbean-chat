/**
 * What starts the flow, as the first card on the canvas.
 *
 * A flow reads as one sentence — this happens, then this — and the canvas used
 * to start halfway through it: the card badged "Starts here" was a step that
 * answers something, with no sign of what.
 *
 * **It looks like a step on purpose.** An earlier cut gave it its own chrome to
 * say "this is not a step", and what that actually communicated was "this is
 * not part of the flow" — which is the opposite of why it is here. It uses
 * `.fb-node` and the same header/title/body structure, so it stays identical to
 * a step card by construction rather than by two sets of values kept in step.
 * The one difference is the accent, which comes from `--flow-accent` like every
 * other card's does.
 *
 * **It is not a node, and must never become one.** Triggers are `Trigger` rows,
 * not graph nodes: they carry a platform binding, a priority that is
 * workspace-wide, and an enabled flag, none of which a graph node has. So this
 * card is injected into the *projection* in store/selectors.ts and never into
 * `nodeType` / `nodeOrder`, which is what `toGraph()` serializes.
 *
 * Clicking it selects it, exactly as clicking a step does, and the left column
 * shows what can be changed — see editor/StepEditor.tsx. The fields themselves
 * still belong to the Django drawer: a second trigger editor in React would be
 * a second place for the platform gate to be wrong.
