/**
 * Debounced autosave (SPEC §16: 2 s), driven by the store from outside React.
 *
 * Four decisions here are not obvious and are worth stating.
 *
 * **Never abort an in-flight PUT.** The obvious way to supersede a save is to
 * abort it and send the newer graph, but an aborted request may already have
 * committed server-side — leaving the user looking at "unsaved" over a saved
 * draft, and the store holding a stale version number. Instead at most one
 * request is in flight, and the next one fires the moment it lands.
 *
 * **Validation is stamped with the revision it describes.** Otherwise a verdict
 * about a graph two edits ago badges nodes the user has already fixed.
 *
 * **A 422 is not retried.** Nothing was written, and the same bytes will be
 * rejected the same way; the loop stays armed so the next edit tries again.
 *
 * **Read-only never installs this at all.** Not a no-op guard inside it — no
 * subscription and no timer, so there is nothing that could fire.
