/**
 * Human labels for schema properties.
 *
 * The artefact carries almost no `title` keywords, and its `description`s are
 * developer copy citing SPEC sections — useful as help text, wrong as a label.
 * So a property falls back through: schema `title`, a translated lookup, then
 * a humanised property name. A node type added later gets the humanised form,
 * which is serviceable; adding a translation key here is the optional polish.
 *
 * Every lookup is resolved through `i18n.t()` at call time, not stored as a
 * frozen table — these functions are called fresh on every render, so the
 * active language is always the one that renders.

 *
 * Keys, not node types, because the same property means the same thing
 * wherever it appears — `followup` is a wait on send_message and on
 * data_collection alike. A property in no group falls into the last one, so a
 * property added by a later layer is never silently dropped off the panel.
 *
 * `key` is the group's stable identity — used for matching and as a React
 * list key — and stays the same across languages; `addGroupLabel(key)` is
 * the translated heading, resolved at render time so it is never frozen to
 * whatever language was active when this module loaded.
