/**
 * The island's entry point.
 *
 * Everything it needs is a data attribute on the mount div that
 * templates/flows/edit.html renders, so nothing here reverses a URL or knows a
 * workspace id. The server-rendered fallback inside that div stays until the
 * mount succeeds, so a slow parse is not a blank rectangle.
 *
 * Nothing in here is allowed to throw past this file. A bootstrap failure and a
 * render failure both have to end up as a message in the mount div, because the
 * alternative is the "Loading the flow builder…" placeholder sitting there
 * forever with the reason only in the console.
