# django-csp 4.x dict form. Studio is still on 3.x's module-level CSP_* names,
# which 4.0 removed; a greenfield project has no reason to adopt the retired
# spelling. Per-request nonces come from ``csp.constants.NONCE`` and are read
# in templates as ``{{ request.csp_nonce }}``.

#: Origins a form submission may finish its redirect chain on (issue #115).
#:
#: Chrome and Safari check ``form-action`` against **every hop** of the
#: navigation a form submission starts, not just the form's immediate target,
#: and they check it against the policy of the page that held the form. Firefox
#: does not, and the specification question is still open as
#: w3c/webappsec-csp#8 — but two engines out of three enforce it, so every flow
#: here that posts to itself and answers a redirect to a provider is a button
#: that does nothing until that provider's origin is named below.
#:
#: "Every hop" is why several of these are a provider's whole domain rather than
#: the one host we navigate to first. A provider that bounces its own dialog
#: between subdomains — Meta serves the mobile dialog from ``m.`` and the
#: Business login from ``business.`` — puts that bounce inside the same
#: navigation, where the directive is checked again. Naming only the entry host
#: would leave issue #115 reproducible on a phone, so each entry is as wide as
#: the provider's own redirects and no wider.
#:
#: That is the trade being made: ``form-action`` exists to stop an injected form
#: posting a page's contents somewhere of the attacker's choosing, and every
#: entry gives back a little of it. These are four named third parties that
#: cannot be made to echo a request back to an attacker, which is what keeps the
#: trade cheap. ``tests/form_action.py`` is the inventory and the argument for
#: each one; the sweep over it fails on a sixth appearing as readily as on one
#: of these going stale.
