    """``path(route, include(module))`` per mount, or nothing when ``app`` is absent.

    ``include()`` imports the module it names *at URLConf build time*, and an app
    module that declares models raises ``RuntimeError`` when its app is not in
    ``INSTALLED_APPS``. So an unconditional include turns "this deployment does
    not run that app" into "this deployment does not boot" — which would undo
    the late-resolving seams (``apps/flows/analytics.py``,
    ``apps/messaging/analytics.py``) that exist precisely so an absent app costs
    a feature rather than the process.

    **The mounts are (route, module) pairs rather than built ``path()`` objects**,
    and that is the whole reason this takes strings. Python evaluates arguments
    before the call, so passing ``path("", include("apps.x.urls"))`` would run the
    import *on the way in* and raise before the guard was ever consulted — a
    guard that reads correctly and does nothing. Building them in here is what
    defers the import to the branch that wants it.

    A helper rather than an ``if`` around the list so every mount point of one
    app reads the same and none can be guarded while its sibling is not.
