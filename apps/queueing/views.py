"""``/internal/tick`` — an HTTP drain for hosts with no long-lived worker.

SPEC §15: "``/internal/tick?token=`` HTTP wrapper (constant-time token compare,
env ``TICK_TOKEN``) for external pingers. Behavior identical to one worker
cycle; safe to run concurrently with a worker."

The concurrency safety is not a claim made here — it is the ``FOR UPDATE SKIP
LOCKED`` claim in ``apps.queueing.worker``. This view calls the same
``drain()`` every worker calls; nothing about being reached over HTTP changes
what a claim does.

**Why a bare token rather than the shared signer.** ``apps/common/signing.py``
lists this route among its consumers, and this is a deliberate, documented
divergence. A signed token buys expiry and purpose-scoping; the caller here is a
third-party pinger (cron-job.org, Uptime Robot, a Kubernetes CronJob) that
stores one URL in its configuration and calls it forever, so the token would
have to be minted with ``max_age=None`` — at which point it is a bare token with
extra steps, and rotating it means re-minting and re-pasting rather than
changing one environment variable. The properties that actually matter are kept:
constant-time comparison, and a bare 404 for every failure including a missing
configuration (SECURITY-BASELINE §4).

#: Deliberately shorter than ``manage.py tick``'s 55 s.
#:
#: Gunicorn runs at its default 30 s worker timeout in the Dockerfile and the
#: compose stack alike, so a request that worked for 55 s would be killed
#: mid-batch — the rows would sit in ``running`` until zombie recovery ten
#: minutes later, and
#: the operator would see a 502 from a tick that was working perfectly well.
#: The budget is checked between batches, so the real ceiling is this plus one
#: batch.
MAX_SECONDS = 20

#: Smaller than the worker's 50, because this budget is enforced by gunicorn.
#:
#: drain() checks the deadline between actions, so the overrun is bounded by
#: one slow handler rather than a whole batch — but the claim itself is still
#: work this request has taken responsibility for, and a smaller claim means
#: less to hand back when the budget runs out. A deployment whose handlers are
#: slow enough for this to matter wants a real worker process; this endpoint is
#: the fallback for hosts that cannot run one.
