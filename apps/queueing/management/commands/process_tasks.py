"""The long-lived worker (SPEC §15). What every ``worker`` process runs:
the compose stacks' ``worker`` service, Railway's worker service, and
``make worker`` locally.

Loop shape, per SPEC §15: "every 1 s, claim up to 50 due rows ... process each".
With one refinement: the sleep happens only when a batch came back *short*. A
full batch means there is more work waiting, and pausing a second between full
batches would cap throughput at 50 actions/second no matter how many workers
were running — an artificial ceiling on exactly the backlog the worker exists to
clear.

Run as many of these as you like. Safety comes from the claim statement
(``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``) and the contact advisory locks, not from there
being one of them.
