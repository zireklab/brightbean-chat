"""``POST /api/v1/messages`` — SPEC §17's send endpoint.

One route, and almost all of it is translation. The send itself is
``apps.messaging.services.send_via_api``, which L3-A shipped for this endpoint:
*"A send from the public API (#25). Automation rules, no agent allowance."*
That last clause matters — the human-agent allowance is hard-coded to inbox
sends (SPEC §22), and an API caller must not be able to buy a seven-day Meta
window by claiming to be a person.

**Compliance never raises.** ROADMAP contract 1 makes a denial a value: the
facade returns a ``Message`` with ``status=failed`` and a code from
``apps.messaging.codes.Denial``. This router is where that becomes SPEC §17's
422 with a machine-readable reason, and the distinction it draws is the one that
matters to a caller — a *denial* means "this send is not allowed and retrying
will not help", while a *failure* means "the platform did not take it this
time", which the send pipeline is already retrying.

**One ``Failure`` code breaks that second half of the dichotomy on purpose:**
``withdrawn`` (``apps.messaging.services.withdraw_send``) means work that
produced this message was cancelled — nothing is retrying it, ever, same as a
denial. So it gets the same treatment as a ``Denial`` here even though it
lives in the other enum; see ``_TERMINAL_CODES`` below.
