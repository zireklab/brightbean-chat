"""Issuing keys and configuring webhooks — the write path behind the settings UI.

The views are thin; the rules are here, so a management command, a shell or a
later internal caller gets the same enforcement a form post does. That is the
same reasoning ``apps.contacts.services`` applies to contact writes, and the
same one BrightBean Studio's ``api_keys.services`` applies to issuance.

**Two gates on issuing a key, and they are at different tiers.**

The *page* is org-tier: SPEC §4.1 puts ``manage_api_keys`` at the organization,
because a key spans "any workspace in the org", and this repo expresses org
authority as ``@require_org_role`` rather than an org permission table (there is
none — see ``apps/members/roles.py``). So an org admin or owner reaches the
page.

The *target workspace* is workspace-tier: issuing a key for a workspace also
requires ``manage_api_keys`` there, which is the merged code's existing
admin-only key. An org admin who is not an admin of a particular workspace does
not get to mint a credential inside it by going around the workspace's own
membership.

**Scopes are capped once, at issuance.** A scope may not grant a permission the
issuer does not hold. After that the key is independent of them — see
``ApiKey``'s docstring for why that is deliberate rather than an oversight.
