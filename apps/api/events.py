"""Subscribing to the internal event catalog (ROADMAP contract 7).

Contract 7 spreads its catalog across apps on purpose — ``apps/contacts/events.py``,
``apps/messaging/events.py`` and ``apps/flows/events.py`` each own an
``EVENT_CATALOG`` and each says, in as many words, that issue #25 unions them
and that there is deliberately no cross-app registry for a handful of strings.

So this module unions them by **discovery** rather than by a list. It walks the
installed apps looking for an ``events`` module with an ``EVENT_CATALOG`` and
connects one receiver to every signal it finds. That is not tidiness: SPEC §5
lists ``broadcast.finished`` among the subscribable events and L6-B is what
emits it. Discovery is what makes "the subscription is data-driven, so no code
change is needed when it appears" true — and it has now been paid out once:
``apps/broadcasts/events.py`` (issue #23) landed with an ``EVENT_CATALOG`` and
its event started being delivered with nothing in this module edited. The next
one does the same.

Every payload in the catalog carries ``event`` as well as being keyed by it,
precisely so one receiver can bind to all of them and dispatch on the string.

**Nothing here imports** ``apps.api.models`` **at module scope** — models.py
reads :data:`SUBSCRIBABLE_EVENTS` from here, and the cycle would be immediate.

#: The events an operator may subscribe an endpoint to. This is the *offered*
#: set, which is not the same as the *emitted* set: an event may be offered
#: before anything emits it, in which case subscribing is a no-op rather than an
#: error. ``broadcast.finished`` was that case until issue #23. Keeping the list
#: here rather than deriving it from :func:`discover_catalog` means the settings
#: UI offers a stable set of checkboxes that does not change shape depending on
#: which apps happen to be installed.
#:
#: SPEC §5's ``outbound_webhook.events`` column names five of these seven. The two
#: sequence events are L6-A's (issue #22) and were added here with it: the
#: Layer-6 gate requires them to reach a subscriber, and contract 7 lists them
#: in the catalog, but :func:`on_catalog_event` drops anything outside this
#: tuple and ``apps.api.services._validated_events`` refuses to store a
#: subscription to one — so discovery alone is not enough to deliver them. The
#: SPEC list predates the catalog; this is the catalog's half of it.

#: Contract 7 promises its payloads carry "workspace id, contact id, and

#: :func:`publishable` applies is *ids plus this set* rather than "everything
#: except the envelope", because the denylist form publishes whatever a future
#: emitter happens to add — an outbound surface should widen deliberately, not
#: by side effect. Anything ending in ``_id`` still passes, so an emitter that
#: landed later (``broadcast.finished``'s ``broadcast_id``) needed no change
#: here, which is the property SPEC §5 asks for.
