"""Models for the public REST API and outbound webhooks (SPEC §5, §17).

Three tables, all workspace-scoped:

``ApiKey``
    The bearer credential. Digest only — the plaintext exists in the response
    that minted it and nowhere else (CONTRIBUTING.md → Secrets).

``OutboundWebhook``
    An operator-configured receiver. Its secret is *recoverable*, unlike an API
    key's: the operator has to be able to put the same value into their own
    verifier, so it is an ``EncryptedTextField`` alongside the digest pattern
    rather than a one-way digest. That is ``ChannelConnection.webhook_secret``'s
    shape, for the same reason.

``WebhookDelivery``
    One row per delivery attempt outcome, capped per webhook by the hourly
    housekeeping sweep. Records status, duration and response code — never the
    request or response body, which can carry a receiver's own credentials in a
    URL or an error string.

    Deliberately coarse, not a mirror of ``PERMISSION_KEYS``. Fine-grained
    scopes are named out of scope by issue #25, and a key that can be granted
    every workspace permission is a key that can eventually mint another key.
    ``apps.api.auth.SCOPE_PERMISSIONS`` is where these become an
    ``effective_permissions`` mapping.

    ``erase`` is the third, added by issue #29 for SPEC §19's GDPR erasure, and
    it is separate from ``write`` rather than folded into it for one reason:
    ``apps.api.services._validated_scopes`` caps a requested scope against the
    permissions the *issuer* holds, so a scope carrying the admin-only
    ``erase_contacts`` key can only ever be granted by an admin — the property
    an admin-tier capability needs, obtained from machinery that already exists.
    Folding it into ``write`` would instead have handed irreversible erasure to
    every key already issued, at upgrade, with nothing on the keys page
    changing. A capability nobody asked for and nobody was told about is not a
    scope; it is a surprise.

    Adding a member here needs no migration: ``ApiKey.scopes`` is a plain
    ``JSONField`` with no ``choices=``, and ``services.known_scopes()`` derives
    the issuance form from this enum intersected with ``SCOPE_PERMISSIONS``.

    until it is explicitly revoked. BrightBean Studio re-intersects on every
    request so that demoting the issuer shrinks the key silently; SPEC §5's row
    has no issuer at all, and a self-hosted integration that stops working hours
    after an unrelated staffing change — with nothing in the 403 to explain
    why — is the worse failure. Removing someone's access is a deliberate
    revoke here, not a side effect.
