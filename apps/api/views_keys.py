"""Org-level API key management, mounted at ``/organization/api-keys/``.

SPEC §4.1 puts ``manage_api_keys`` at the organization tier — a key spans "any
workspace in the org" — and ``config/urls.py`` has carried a stub at this exact
path, named for this issue, since Layer 1. This replaces the stub; the URL name
``settings_org_api_keys`` and the nav row that reverses it are unchanged, which
is the contract that file's comment states.

Authority is checked twice, at two tiers, and the second check is the one people
forget: ``@require_org_role("admin")`` gets you the page, and
``apps.api.services.issue_api_key`` separately requires ``manage_api_keys`` in
the *target* workspace. An org admin who is not an admin of one workspace does
not get to mint a credential inside it.

**The plaintext key is rendered in the response to the POST that created it.**
No redirect, no ``messages`` framework — messages are stored in the session,
which in this project is a database table, so a redirect-then-show would leave a
live credential sitting in ``django_session`` for the life of the session
(SECURITY-BASELINE §5). ``apps/channels/views.py`` gives up Post/Redirect/Get
for the same reason and says so.
