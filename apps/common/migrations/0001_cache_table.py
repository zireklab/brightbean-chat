"""Provision the database cache table.

``CACHE_URL`` defaults to ``dbcache://cache_table``: LocMemCache is per-process
and every deployment runs gunicorn with more than one worker, so a per-IP
counter kept there is evaded by landing on another worker — which is exactly
what the auth rate limiter must not allow (SECURITY-BASELINE §8).
Postgres is the rate limiter (SPEC §22, no Redis).

``manage.py createcachetable`` would be a second, forgettable deploy step; every
path that already runs migrations (``docker compose up``, the compose stack's
one-shot ``migrate`` service, Railway's pre-deploy command, pytest's
test-database setup) gets the table from here instead.

The table name is **not** hardcoded. ``createcachetable`` with no arguments reads
``settings.CACHES`` and creates the table each database-backed alias actually
names, so a deployment that sets ``CACHE_URL=dbcache://something_else`` gets
that table — and one that points ``CACHE_URL`` at local memory gets no table at
all, which is also correct.
