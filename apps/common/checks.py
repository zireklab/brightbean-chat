"""Deploy-safety system checks (SECURITY-BASELINE §8).

``config/settings/base.py`` refuses to boot without ``SECRET_KEY``,
``ENCRYPTION_KEY_SALT`` and ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``. That check runs while settings
are being *imported*, off the environment's ``DEBUG`` value, which makes it
sensitive to import order: a settings module that sets ``DEBUG = False`` after
``from .base import *`` gets the development branch — the hardcoded,
repo-public key and salt — and then looks like production.

That is exactly the bug this file exists to catch. These checks read the
**fully-loaded** settings, so they see what the process will actually run with
no matter how the module was assembled. ``manage.py check`` runs them, and
Django runs them before ``runserver`` and every management command.
