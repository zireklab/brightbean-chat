"""Global template context: the sidebar navigation and its data.

Ported from BrightBean Studio's ``apps/common/context_processors.py``, keeping
its shape (``{}`` for anonymous users, function-local model imports) and
rewriting the queries for chat.

**Deviation 4 of the L1-B brief lives here.** Studio computes sidebar active
state inline, per link, against ``request.resolver_match`` — at three different
granularities across 13 call sites (``url_name``; ``url_name`` A-or-B;
``app_name``; ``url_name`` *and* ``app_name``) — while its settings layouts use
a fourth convention entirely: a ``settings_active`` string that 11 separate
views have to remember to put in their context. Here the navigation is a data
structure, the ``active`` flag is computed once, and every template renders it
in a loop. A new page becomes an entry in a list, not a fifth convention.

    the reason NavItem.visible_to states: a row that always answers 403 reads as

    the first three of it — how many rows fit under a heading is the template's

    every response including error pages: the app may not be installed
