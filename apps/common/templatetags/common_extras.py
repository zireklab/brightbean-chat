    every key and string, which would otherwise terminate the attribute. The
    browser HTML-decodes the attribute value before the JS engine parses it, so
    Alpine still sees valid JSON.

    The order matters and is easy to invert: escape the *output* of
    ``json.dumps``, then ``mark_safe``. Marking safe first, or reaching for
    ``|safe`` on a pre-serialized string, reopens attribute injection.

    Pass Python values (list/dict/None), NOT pre-serialized JSON strings — a
    JSON string input gets double-encoded into a quoted string literal.

    ``None`` and ``""`` both become ``[]``. The empty string is Django's
    ``string_if_invalid`` fallback for a template variable that does not
    resolve, so an unresolvable name yields an empty Alpine array rather than a
