"""Shared validation utilities.

Ported from BrightBean Studio's ``apps/common/validators.py``. Studio's
``is_safe_url`` / ``resolve_public_ip`` SSRF helpers are deliberately **not**
here: SECURITY-BASELINE §6 puts the one shared SSRF guard in issue #15 and
forbids any server-side fetch of a user-supplied URL until it lands. Shipping a
weaker lookalike now would create exactly the tempting, TOCTOU-prone call site
the baseline is written to prevent. Tag and XML helpers follow their consumers
(#3 contacts, #4 webhooks).

:func:`is_renderable_url` below is the other half of that sentence and is not an
exception to it — see its docstring.

    **This is not an SSRF guard and must never be used as one.** It answers a
    rendering question — "is putting this in the DOM safe for the reader" — not
    a fetching question. The one mandatory path for a *server-side* request to a
    user-supplied URL is issue #15's shared guard, and the module docstring above
    says why a lookalike must not appear here. Nothing in this function resolves
    a hostname, and a URL it accepts may still point at localhost.

    What it rejects is the set of schemes that execute or impersonate when a
    browser follows them: ``javascript:`` (script in a link), ``data:`` (an
    attacker-authored document on our origin's coat-tails), ``vbscript:``,
    ``file:``, and everything else unknown. Media URLs on a message body arrive
    from strangers and are stored verbatim —
    ``apps.messaging.ingest`` caps their length and strips NULs but deliberately
    does not check the scheme — so ``javascript:alert(1)`` is a value that can
    legitimately be sitting in ``Message.body`` right now.

    Also rejected: a scheme-relative ``//host/path``, which inherits whatever
    scheme the page was served over and reads as a path to anyone skimming the
    stored value, and anything ``urlsplit`` cannot parse.
