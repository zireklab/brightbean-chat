"""The sequence list, the step editor and the subscriber panel.

Reads are open to any workspace member and writes require ``edit_flows`` — the
same split ``apps/flows/views.py`` uses, and the same permission, because a
sequence is a schedule over flows and anyone who may edit one may edit the
other. ``PERMISSION_KEYS`` in ``apps/members/roles.py`` is the whole vocabulary;
this app invents none.

Everything except the two pages is HTMX: mutations answer with a toast and a
``sequencesChanged`` or ``sequenceStepsChanged`` event, and the affected partial
re-fetches itself. One renderer per region rather than one per action.

Every mutation answers **2xx even when it refuses**, following
``apps/flows/views_triggers.py``: htmx drops ``HX-Trigger`` on a non-2xx
response, so a 400 would show the user no toast at all and the request would
simply appear to do nothing.
