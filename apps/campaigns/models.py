"""Sequences, their steps and their enrollments — SPEC §5 (campaigns), §12.

A sequence is a drip campaign: an ordered list of steps, each of which waits a
delay and then **starts a flow**. It owns no message content of its own, and
that is the design rather than an omission — one send path (a flow's
``send_message`` node, through ``apps.messaging.services``) means one place
where compliance, rate limiting and rendering happen. A step that wanted to send
directly would be a second write site, and
``apps/messaging/tests/test_write_sites.py`` fails the build on one.

Four tables:

``Sequence``
    The campaign. Exposes ``name`` and ``.objects.for_workspace(...)``, which is
    the whole contract ``apps/flows/picklists.py::_sequences`` needs.
``SequenceStep``
    ``position``, a delay, a send window and the flow to start.
``SequenceEnrollment``
    One contact's progress. A **partial** unique index allows at most one
    ``active`` row per (sequence, contact) while leaving the history of
    completed and unsubscribed rows intact — SPEC §12's "re-enrollment restarts
    from step 1 (previous enrollment marked unsubscribed)" needs both halves.
``RuleTriggerFire``
    The rule trigger's per-contact-per-trigger cooldown. See
    :mod:`apps.campaigns.rules`.

**Why two of these are** ``ContactScopedModel``. It derives ``workspace`` from
the contact and refuses a peer whose workspace disagrees, which is exactly the
invariant these rows need: an enrollment joins a contact to a sequence, and a
row where those two belong to different tenants is a tenancy bug no test
stumbles over by accident.
