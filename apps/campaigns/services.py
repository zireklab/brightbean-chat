"""The only write path for sequences, steps and enrollments.

Every mutation goes through a function here rather than through the ORM
directly, for the reason ``apps/contacts/services.py`` gives for contacts: the
internal event catalog (:mod:`apps.campaigns.events`, ROADMAP contract 7) is
what rule triggers and outbound webhooks subscribe to, and a write that bypasses
this module is a change the rest of the product never learns about.

Three behaviours worth reading before calling anything:

**Re-enrollment restarts at step 1.** SPEC §12: subscribing a contact who is
already active retires the existing enrollment (status ``unsubscribed``, queued
steps cancelled) and creates a new one at position 1. The partial unique index
on ``(sequence, contact) WHERE status='active'`` means the database enforces
that rather than this function remembering to.

**Unsubscribing stops future steps; it does not stop the present one.** The
enrollment's status flips and its *pending* queue rows are cancelled. A step a
worker has already claimed, and any ``FlowExecution`` it started, runs to
completion — SPEC §12 says so in as many words, and reaching into a running
execution would mean this app knowing how to interrupt the engine.

**Subscribing to a sequence with no steps completes immediately.** There is
nothing to wait for, so the enrollment is created ``completed`` and the
``sequence.subscribed`` event still fires — the contact really was subscribed,
and a consumer counting subscriptions should not have to special-case an empty
campaign.
