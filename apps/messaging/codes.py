"""The machine-readable codes an outbound message can carry.

``Message.error`` holds one of these and nothing else. A provider's own error
text routinely quotes the request that caused it — including an access token in
a query string — and this column is rendered in the inbox (SECURITY-BASELINE
§5), so the sentence a human reads is looked up from :data:`REASON_COPY` at
render time rather than stored per row. That is the same "registered copy, not
an f-string at the call site" shape ``apps.notifications.events`` uses.

Four vocabularies, kept apart because they answer different questions:

``Grant``   why a send was allowed — which is not decoration. ``human_agent``
            and ``tag_supplied`` are the difference between a compliant Meta
            send and one that can get a page disabled, and an operator asking
            "why did this go out?" is asking for exactly this word.
``Denial``  why compliance refused. Lands on the message row.
``Failure`` why the provider call did not produce a sent message.
``Limit``   why the organization's own plan refused. Optional: on a
            deployment with no billing configured nothing can produce one.
