"""Invitation and membership lifecycle.

Ported from BrightBean Studio's ``apps/members/services.py``. The role-level
maps are imported from :mod:`apps.members.roles` rather than re-declared with a
"must match decorators.py" comment (deviation 6).

Two rules define what anyone may do here:

* **Org tier.** Only an owner can create another admin. An admin inviting an
  admin is a lateral privilege clone, which is exactly what a compromised admin
  account wants; member-tier invites stay open so a workspace admin who is only
  an org *member* can still bring collaborators in.
* **Workspace tier.** Authority over a workspace assignment requires
  ``manage_members`` **in that workspace** — or org ownership, which confers
  workspace-admin authority everywhere in the org. This is where the
  ``manage_members`` permission key from SPEC §4 actually binds: an Editor
  cannot manage members, because Editor does not hold the key.

Both directions are checked. Studio learned the second one the hard way: without
a check against the *existing* role, a low-authority admin could demote an owner
simply by submitting the assignment form with ``role=viewer`` — the requested
level passes a "not higher than mine" test, and the demotion of the owner row is
the privilege violation.
