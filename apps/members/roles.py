"""Roles, levels and the permission matrix — defined exactly once.

BrightBean Studio keeps three copies of its role-level maps: two inside
``apps/members/decorators.py`` and one in ``apps/members/services.py``, held in
sync by a ``# must match decorators.py`` comment. A permission system whose
authority ordering can disagree with itself is a permission system that will,
eventually, disagree with itself. Everything lives here and both modules import
it (brief, deviation 6).

The four workspace roles are SPEC §4's, not Studio's six: Studio's ``manager`` /
``contributor`` / ``client`` split serves an agency approval workflow this
product does not have, and its ``CustomRole`` escape hatch is dropped outright
(deviation 5) — it shipped with no UI, no service functions, and a
``require_workspace_role`` that ignored it despite a docstring claiming
otherwise.

``PERMISSION_KEYS`` and the four rows below are the whole authorization
vocabulary. Later layers gate on these keys; they do not invent new ones without
adding them here first.
