"""Member management, org-scoped.

Mounted at ``/organization/members/``: memberships and invitations belong to the
organization, and one invitation can carry assignments for several workspaces at
once. Authority is checked twice and at different levels — ``require_org_role``
gates the pages, and :mod:`apps.members.services` gates each individual
workspace assignment on ``manage_members`` *in that workspace*. That second
check is what the SPEC §4 permission table is for: an Editor holds no
``manage_members`` anywhere, so an Editor cannot manage members.

Plain form posts and redirects rather than Studio's HTMX fragments: HTMX arrives
with issue #32, and building against a library this branch does not vendor would
ship a page that silently does nothing. #32 restyles and can convert these.
