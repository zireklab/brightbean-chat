"""The inbox's notification events, registered from this app rather than #7's.

``apps/notifications/events.py`` already carries ``inbox_reminder`` — its comment
reads "SPEC §14: a scheduled_action that becomes an in-app notification", and it
was registered ahead of this issue with ``emails_by_default=False`` because an
in-app reminder you set for yourself is the whole point of one. So this module
only adds the event that module could not have anticipated: what a scheduled
reply says when it fails.

Registered from here the way that module invites — "a later app registers from
its own AppConfig.ready() and never edits this file" — and ``register_event`` is
a no-op for an identical re-registration, so an autoreloaded ``ready()`` is
harmless.
