"""The worker half of the inbox: a reminder comes due, a scheduled reply goes out.

Registered types, not new enum members. ``apps.queueing.models.ActionType`` is
documented as **not a closed set** — "the authority on what may be processed is
the handler registry" — and it is deliberately not attached to the column as
``choices=`` so that a later app can register a type without shipping an
``AlterField`` migration in ``apps.queueing``. Its docstring names these two by
hand. ``apps/flows/triggers/handlers.py`` set the precedent with a local
``ROUTE_EVENT`` constant, and :mod:`apps.inbox.services` holds ours.

Three things the queue guarantees, so nothing here re-does them: the handler runs
inside a transaction that already holds the contact advisory lock (both rows name
a contact); raising retries on SPEC §15's backoff ladder; returning normally
marks the row done in the same transaction as the work.

Which makes the interesting decision here the *opposite* of raising, twice over.

**Nothing raises after the send.** ``send_as_agent``'s message row and its
``dispatched_at`` claim are savepoints inside this handler's transaction, so a
raise after the provider call has gone out rolls both back while the message is
already delivered — and the retry sends it again. Everything fallible therefore
happens **before** the send; after it there are only status writes, and even the
notification is wrapped.

**A refused send is not a retry.** Compliance denying at fire time is the
scheduled reply's answer, not a transient failure: five attempts over six hours
cannot reopen a messaging window. It is recorded, surfaced and notified, and the
handler returns — the shape ``apps/messaging/handlers.py::handle_send_retry``
already uses for the same verdict.
