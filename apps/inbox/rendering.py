"""Turning an attacker-authored ``Message.body`` into something safe to render.

This is the sharp end of the inbox. SECURITY-BASELINE §2: message text,
usernames, profile fields and media URLs are all attacker-controlled, and a
thread is the one place in the product where a stranger's bytes reach a team
member's browser. Every block here arrived over a webhook.

The discipline is:

* **No HTML is produced in this module.** It returns plain view models and the
  templates render them under Django's default autoescaping. Nothing in
  ``apps.inbox`` calls ``mark_safe`` or ``format_html``, and
  ``tests/test_hostile_content.py`` scans the package's AST to keep it that way
  — the same assertion ``apps.messaging`` makes about itself.
* **A URL is checked before it can become an ``href`` or a ``src``**, with
  :func:`apps.common.validators.is_renderable_url`. ``apps.messaging.ingest``
  stores attachment URLs verbatim (it caps length and strips NULs, and
  deliberately does not look at the scheme), so ``javascript:alert(1)`` is a
  value that really can be in a body.
* **Anything that cannot be shown safely becomes a tombstone**, not silence.
  ``apps.messaging.rendering.outbound_from_body`` drops what it does not
  recognise, which is right for a retry — sending less beats sending something
  wrong — but wrong for a reader, who would be looking at a thread with a hole
  in it and no way to know. A rejected URL, an unrecognised block type and an
  empty body all render as a visible marker instead.

Which HTML tag a media block earns is decided here rather than in the template,
because the answer comes from the Content-Security-Policy in
``config/settings/base.py``: ``img-src`` allows ``https:``, so an image is an
``<img>``; ``media-src`` is ``'self' blob:`` only, so an ``<audio>`` or
``<video>`` pointing at a platform CDN would be blocked by the browser and
render as a broken control. Those become labelled links.

**Media identifiers are the other kind of block.** A ``media`` block holds no
URL at all — it holds the id the platform gave us, because fetching it needs
that connection's credentials (``apps.channels.events.EventPayload`` draws the
line, ``apps.channels.media`` does the resolving). What this module puts in the
view model is a link to :func:`apps.inbox.views.media`, our own workspace-scoped
route, so the address in the DOM is one we minted and not one a stranger chose —
which is why :func:`is_renderable_url` is not consulted for it, and must not be:
the function answers a question about somebody else's string.

The block carries ``media_kind`` — what the platform *called* it — and that
decides the tag, exactly as it does for a ``file``/``audio``/``video`` block: an
image (or a platform that did not say) becomes a :class:`Media` part rendered as
an ``<img>``, and anything else becomes the same :class:`Link` part every other
non-image attachment already uses. Without it every voice note and PDF rendered
as a broken image icon.

Using the platform's word here is **not** in tension with SECURITY-BASELINE §9's
"sniff, do not trust". The two answer different questions: this one picks a tag
before any bytes exist, while §9 governs the ``Content-Type`` and the
disposition on the bytes themselves, which :mod:`apps.channels.media` still
decides by reading them. A platform that lies about the kind gets a link where a
picture would have been, or a broken ``<img>`` — never an inline render of
something that should have been an attachment.

    ``labels``, ``members`` and ``connections`` are id → name maps the caller

    queries per row on a list that exists to be scanned.

    An id that no longer resolves becomes a visible placeholder rather than
    disappearing — the :class:`Tombstone` argument again. A rule quietly
    describing itself as doing less than it does is how an operator ends up
    debugging automation that is not in front of them.
