"""The inbox: conversation list, thread, agent reply, assignment, pause (SPEC §14).

Two rules shape almost every function here.

**Reads are ``use_inbox``, writes are ``reply_in_inbox``.** SPEC §4.2 gives a
Viewer ``use_inbox`` and nothing else, so a Viewer sees the whole inbox and can
change none of it; ``reply_in_inbox`` is held by agent, editor and admin, which
is exactly the "Agent+" the issue asks for on assignment. No new permission key.

**Messaging state is mutated only through** :mod:`apps.messaging.services`
(ROADMAP contract 1). ``send_as_agent`` already applies the +30 minute
automation pause and already has an ``internal=True`` note path; neither is
re-implemented here, and the 30 minutes is imported as
``AGENT_AUTOMATION_PAUSE`` rather than written down a second time. A compliance
refusal is not an exception — the facade returns a ``Message`` with
``status=failed`` and a machine code, and this module turns that code into a
sentence with ``apps.messaging.codes.describe``.

**Polling.** ``rows`` and ``messages`` are the two endpoints the page polls
every three seconds, and both go through :func:`apps.common.polling.conditional`
so an unchanged poll is a 304 with no body. Nothing else on this page is
conditional: a mutation's response is never cacheable and never asks.

    it triggers — a request cannot name an arbitrary ``file_id`` or an arbitrary
