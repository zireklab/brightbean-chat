"""Machine-readable failure codes this app raises on its own.

``apps.messaging.codes.describe`` is the vocabulary for anything the *send*
pipeline decided — a compliance denial, a provider rejection — and it returns
the code itself for a string it does not recognise, which is the right default
there and the wrong thing to print in a thread.

So the one failure the inbox reaches on its own gets its sentence here rather
than by widening another app's table for a case that app cannot cause.
:func:`describe_inbox_failure` falls through to ``describe`` for everything else,
so callers need only one function.
