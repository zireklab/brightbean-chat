"""The inbox rules engine: what a rule is, and whether it matches (SPEC §14).

One matcher, two callers. The ``post_persist`` hook scores a
:class:`~apps.channels.events.NormalizedEvent` on its way through the webhook;
the settings page's dry-run scores the last fifty stored ``Message`` rows. If
those were two implementations they would drift, and the dry-run's whole claim is
that it agrees with live behaviour — so both build a :class:`RuleInput` and both
call :func:`matches`, exactly as
:meth:`apps.flows.triggers.matching.MatchContext.from_event` exists so the
matcher never sees a platform payload.

Three halves to a condition, and the split is the issue's:

``channel``
    Rule-local. Two independent filters — platform and connection — ANDed, which
    is what a form with two multi-selects means. An empty list is not a
    constraint.

``keywords``
    Rule-local, and **not** a second keyword matcher.
    :mod:`apps.flows.triggers.keywords` already implements SPEC §10's three modes
    with the casefolding and the 8 kB scan cap, and the ``{"text", "mode"}``
    entries here are the same shape a keyword trigger stores. That module imports
    nothing from this project, so borrowing it costs no coupling.

``contact``
    The condition engine's, through ``apps.contacts.conditions`` — ROADMAP
    contract 8 names inbox rules as one of its four consumers, and its own
    docstring names issue #24. Set-wise in the dry-run
    (:func:`~apps.contacts.conditions.evaluate_many`), one contact at a time in
    the hook. There is no third evaluator.

A rule matches when **every clause it carries** matches. A clause it does not
carry is not a constraint — but a rule carrying no clause at all would match
every inbound message in the workspace, and since the builder's empty state is
exactly that, :func:`validate_condition` refuses to save one. The condition
engine has the same footgun by itself (``match: all`` over zero rules is the
identity of AND, and matches everyone); this is the one place it can be created
by accident.
