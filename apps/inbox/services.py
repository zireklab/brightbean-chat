"""The inbox's own writes: the read cursor, labels, rules, and deferred work.

Every mutation of a *conversation* still goes through
:mod:`apps.messaging.services` (ROADMAP contract 1) or
:mod:`apps.contacts.services`. That is not a style preference: the agent-send
automation pause, compliance, idempotency and the send bucket all live inside the
facade, and ``apps/messaging/tests/test_write_sites.py`` is an AST scan that
fails the build if any module outside messaging assigns
``automation_paused_until``, ``window_expires_at`` or ``opted_out_at``.

What is here is the inbox's own tables. Two habits run through all of it.

*Schedule through the queue, cancel by pk.* ``apps.queueing`` has no cancel API —
``ActionStatus.CANCELLED`` is "set by owners of the work, never by the worker" —
so cancelling is an ``update()`` on the row this app stored the id of. Filtering
by ``type=`` instead would be a scan that could catch somebody else's action.

*An idempotency key carries the run time.* ``schedule()`` returns the existing row
**unchanged whatever its status** when a key is already present, so a key without
the time in it would make "move this reminder from 3pm to 5pm" hand back the 3pm
row and 5pm would never fire. ``apps/messaging/handlers.py`` learned this first
and its comment is the longer version.
