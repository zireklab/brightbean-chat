"""The analytics pages (SPEC §18).

Three of them, all read-only except the last:

``overview``
    Every flow that has moved a counter in the range, and the per-connection
    deliverability summary. The section's landing page.
``flow_detail``
    SPEC §18's "flow detail page": headline totals, a 7/30/90-day trend, and the
    per-node table. Distinct from the *builder*, which shows the same counters as
    chips on the canvas — a table is what you read, a chip is what you glance at.
``tracking_settings``
    The two per-workspace email toggles, both off by default.

Everything reads is gated on ``view_analytics``, which every workspace role holds
(``apps.members.roles``) — it is the key SPEC §4.2 gives this section, and naming
it is what makes the gate legible. The toggles are workspace configuration, so
they answer to ``manage_workspace_settings`` instead.

Decorator order is the house one: ``login_required`` → the permission →
the method, so a request from another tenant answers 404 before it can learn that
a 405 would have been the alternative.
