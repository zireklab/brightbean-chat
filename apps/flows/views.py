"""The flow list and the builder's host page.

Reads are open to any workspace member and writes require ``edit_flows`` — the
same split as the data API, and for the same reason (see
:mod:`apps.flows.api`). A Viewer can open the list and the builder; the builder
is handed ``can_edit`` so L3-C can render read-only rather than letting someone
drag nodes around and discover on save that they may not.

Everything except the builder page is HTMX: the mutations answer with a toast
and a ``flowsChanged`` event, and the list re-fetches its own rows. That keeps
one renderer for the table instead of one for the page and one for each action.
