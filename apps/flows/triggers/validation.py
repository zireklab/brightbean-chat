"""Validate a trigger's ``config_json`` — caps first, then the schema.

The order is copied from :func:`apps.flows.schema.envelope.check_limits`, and it
is the order for a reason: measuring depth by walking a document you have not
bounded is how a deeply nested payload becomes a recursion error instead of a
validation finding. So size, then depth, then the schema walk — and each of the
first two returns immediately, because a document that failed them cannot be
meaningfully described by the findings the third would produce.

Never raises. A finding refuses the write and is rendered in the panel; an
exception would be a 500 on a form somebody typed into.
