"""Turning a POST into a validated ``config_json``.

Hand-parsed rather than a ``ModelForm``, because none of the four shapes here is
a flat field set: a keyword list is two parallel ``getlist``s, the comment config
nests, and the JSON schema in :mod:`apps.flows.triggers.schema` is already the
authority on what is valid. A form class would be a second, weaker copy of it.

What this module owns is **normalisation** — trimming, dropping blanks, deduping
— which happens before validation so that a user typing a trailing space does not
get a schema error about it.
