"""One row per trigger type: what it is called, where it can fire, what it configures.

SPEC §10 is a table, so this is a table. Writing it as data rather than as
branches is what lets four unrelated consumers agree without talking to each
other:

* :mod:`apps.flows.triggers.matching` gates an unbound trigger on ``platforms``;
* :func:`apps.flows.triggers.platforms.platforms_for_flow` recomputes the §16
  capability warnings from the same column;
* the connection picker in the panel offers exactly ``platforms``;
* :mod:`apps.flows.triggers.forms` refuses a binding the picker did not offer,
  because the client list is a convenience and never a gate.

Registration is open. L5-A's story and follow triggers and L6-A's rule binding
add a **matcher**, not a spec — every spec ships here today, so a type whose
runtime lands later still validates, still renders in the panel, and still
counts towards a flow's platform set.
