"""The Triggers panel — HTMX CRUD on the flow page, plus the ref-link QR codes.

A module of its own rather than more of ``apps/flows/views.py``, following
``apps/channels/views_webhooks.py``: that file has one concern and an explicit
``__all__``, and eight more views with a different concern would end both.

Reads are open to any workspace member and writes need ``edit_flows`` — the same
split the flow list and the builder API already use, and for the same reason. A
Viewer can open the panel and see what starts this flow; only an Editor changes it.

Every mutation answers **2xx even when it refuses**. htmx drops ``HX-Trigger`` on
a non-2xx response, so a 400 would show the user no toast at all — the request
would simply appear to do nothing. A refusal is an error toast *without* the
``triggersChanged`` event, which leaves the drawer exactly as they left it.
