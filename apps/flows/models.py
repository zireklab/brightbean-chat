"""Flows, their versions, and the executions that run them (SPEC §5, "flows").

Two tenant tables and one invariant worth stating up front: **a flow has at most
one published version.** That is a partial unique index here, not a rule
services remember, because it is what every other layer assumes — the engine
starts "the published version", triggers fire "the published version", and a
second published row would make that phrase ambiguous at the worst moment.

Versioning shape, from the issue: editing writes or updates the *latest draft*,
and publishing flips flags rather than copying a graph. So the newest row is the
draft the builder is editing, unless it is published, in which case the next
edit opens a new one. :mod:`apps.flows.services` owns those transitions —
nothing outside it should be setting ``published`` by hand.

``FlowVersion`` carries its own ``workspace`` foreign key rather than reaching
through ``flow``. SPEC §5 requires one on every tenant table, and it means
``get_scoped_object_or_404(FlowVersion, workspace, ...)`` works directly instead
of via a join that a future query might forget.

``FlowExecution`` is the engine's durable state machine (SPEC §9.2). The
behaviour that reads and writes it lives in :mod:`apps.flows.engine`; what is
here is the table, the status vocabulary, and the two invariants the database
itself holds — one live execution per (contact, flow), and an execution whose
contact, flow and workspace cannot disagree.

    counts. That limiter's window is **clock-aligned**, so a default reply at
    23:59:59 and another at 00:00:01 both pass — which is precisely the "two
    identical fallbacks seconds apart" complaint the guard exists to prevent. Its
    key is a SHA-256 digest, so an operator asking "why did this person get two"
    has nothing readable to look at. And ``hit()`` prunes the whole counter table
    on every new key, on the inbound path, inside SPEC §7.1's 1.5-second budget.

    A row per (contact, connection) with a rolling ``last_sent_at`` is none of
    those things, and it is what "durable" in the issue asks for.

    Workspace-scoped rather than contact-scoped for one reason: the claim below
    is a single ``UPDATE ... WHERE``, and ``ContactScopedModel.save()`` exists to
    police the ``save()`` path, which the claim does not use on its hot leg.
    ``contact`` and ``channel_connection`` are checked against the workspace by
    the service that writes them.

    """One inbound event the **worker** has finished routing. Exactly-once, durably.

    Only the deferred path writes here, and the reason is specific enough to be
    worth stating. ``apps.queueing.worker.process_action`` runs a handler and
    marks the row done in one transaction, so a crash rolls both back and the
    retry is honest. But zombie recovery resets a ``running`` row after ten
    minutes, so a genuinely slow handler can be claimed a second time while the
    first is still in flight. Both take the blocking contact lock, so they
    serialise — and the second then re-runs the pipeline over the first's
    committed work, calling ``start_flow`` again.

    ``send_outbound``'s idempotency key does not save us there: it is
    ``exec:{execution_id}:node:...``, and a second ``start_flow`` mints a *new*
    execution id, so the second welcome message is a legitimately different send.
    SPEC §21 asks for zero duplicate sends across a thousand forced retries.

    So the handler's first act is this insert, and it commits with the work:
    rolled back together when the handler fails (a retry re-runs, correctly),
    committed together when it succeeds (a zombie re-run is a no-op). The inline
    path is single-shot by construction — ``webhook_event_log`` has already
    deduplicated the delivery — and does not pay a write per event.

    has to survive all of them without being re-uploaded or parked in a cookie.

    parse, depth cap, envelope schema with unknown keys rejected, then every
    graph and every trigger config through the validators the product already
    uses. A hostile file is refused before it becomes a row.

    is form input and is re-checked against the workspace on every read, not
