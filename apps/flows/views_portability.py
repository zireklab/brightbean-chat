"""Export a flow, and the three-step wizard that imports one (issue #27).

A module of its own rather than more of ``apps/flows/views.py``, following
``views_triggers.py``: these six views share one concern and none of the others
do.

**Both halves require ``edit_flows``.** Import obviously does — it creates
flows, tags, fields and sequences. Export does too, and the reason is worth
stating because it is not confidentiality: ``GET /w/<id>/api/flows/<id>/``
already serves the whole graph to any member, so gating the download lower
would protect nothing. It is gated because export is an *authoring* action on
the flow surface, ``edit_flows`` is the key this feature is written against
(``docs/agent-prompts/layer-7.md``), and one gate for the whole feature is
easier to reason about than two.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wizard, and the promise it keeps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(``upload`` *or* ``pick a template``) → ``review`` → ``confirm``. The upload
validates and stores; the review asks the mapping questions and shows the dry
run; only the confirm writes. A shipped template is just a pre-loaded import —
it writes the same ``FlowImport`` row and hands off to the same review page, so
the promise below covers it without a second wizard to keep honest. **Nothing but the ``FlowImport`` row exists before the confirm**, which
is the issue's "no object creation before dry-run confirm" and is asserted
directly in ``apps/flows/tests/test_portability_import.py``.

Everything an imported document contains is rendered through Django's
autoescaping — no ``|safe``, no ``mark_safe`` anywhere in the templates this
serves. A template's message bodies carry ``{{placeholders}}`` which
``apps.flows.rendering`` substitutes at send time and no template engine ever
evaluates (SECURITY-BASELINE §3); showing one on a review page must not be the
exception that undoes that.
