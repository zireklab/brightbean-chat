"""Graph validation: what is wrong, and whether it is wrong enough to stop you.

Three tiers, and the difference between the first two is the whole design (see
:mod:`apps.flows.schema.issues`):

* **document errors** — the payload is not storable. Refuse the write.
* **graph errors** — the graph stores fine but will not run. Save it; refuse to
  publish it.
* **warnings** — capability mismatches and unreachable nodes. Never block
  anything (SPEC §9.1: "channel-capability warnings (non-blocking)").

Saving a half-wired graph is not leniency, it is the requirement: SPEC §16 has
the builder autosaving every two seconds, so a draft is *expected* to be caught
mid-edit with an edge hanging off a node the author has not placed yet. Refusing
that save would delete work. Refusing to publish it is a different question, and
the answer there is no.

Cycles are allowed and unremarked — SPEC §9.1 says so explicitly, and the
runtime protects itself with the ``blocks_since_pause`` cap (§9.2) rather than
with a validator that cannot tell a loop from a retry.
