"""Reading a shared template: validate, map, dry-run, then create.

**An import is untrusted input.** A template arrives from a stranger, so this
module is written so that nothing reaches the ORM until the document has been
through the validators the product already trusts, and nothing is *created*
until a person has answered every question the document raises and confirmed a
summary of what will happen.

The order is fixed and each step refuses the next:

1. :func:`~apps.flows.portability.envelope.parse` — size cap, then parse, then
   depth, then a NUL scan. A hostile file costs a length check, not a walk.
2. :func:`~apps.flows.portability.envelope.validate_envelope` — the envelope's
   shape with unknown keys rejected, the two version stamps, then every graph
   through ``apps.flows.schema.validate_graph`` (which is where
   ``MAX_NODES``/``MAX_EDGES``/size/depth are enforced) and every trigger config
   through ``apps.flows.triggers.validation.validate_config``.
3. :func:`requirements_for` — **re-derived from the document**, never read out
   of its ``requirements`` block. A manifest that omits a reference cannot
   therefore talk this module into importing a dangling id; the manifest
   supplies labels and defaults and no authority at all.
4. :func:`plan_import` — the dry run. What would be created, what is still
   unanswered, and every URL an ``external_request`` node would call.
5. :func:`apply_import` — one transaction, and the first write of the whole
   flow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What arrives, and what does not
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An imported flow is a **draft**: ``create_flow`` then ``save_draft``, so it is
version 1, unpublished, ``status=draft``. Publishing stays a human action —
nothing here sets ``published``. Imported triggers are created ``enabled=False``
for the same reason: a template that starts answering a workspace's customers
the moment it is uploaded is not something a stranger's file should be able to
arrange.

``save_draft`` is also deliberately the write path rather than a hand-built
``FlowVersion``. It runs ``sanitize_graph``, so an imported ``send_email``
``html_body`` goes through the same markup allowlist every other write does —
which is the difference between storing a stranger's HTML and storing markup
that will execute in a member's browser when they open the builder.

Nothing here builds a Django ``Template`` from imported text, and nothing may.
``{{placeholders}}`` in an imported message are rendered by
``apps.flows.rendering``, which is plain token substitution with no template
engine to reach (SECURITY-BASELINE §3).

#: The three answers a requirement can be given. ``create`` makes the object,
#: ``map`` points at one that already exists, and ``blank`` is the deliberate
#: "leave it out" available only where leaving it out is a legal document
#: (an unbound trigger, an empty request header).
ACTION_CREATE = "create"
ACTION_MAP = "map"
ACTION_BLANK = "blank"

#: Triggers are not a *requirement* — nothing has to be supplied for one — but
#: the issue asks for them to be skippable, and "this template brings a keyword
#: trigger you may not want" is a real question. They ride in the same mapping
#: dictionary under this pseudo-kind so the wizard has one form and one parser.
TRIGGER_KIND = "trigger"
ACTION_KEEP = "keep"
ACTION_SKIP = "skip"

#: The channel picker's sentinel for "leave this trigger unbound".
#:
#: A separate value from "nothing chosen", because the two are opposite
#: intentions that a ``<select>`` whose blank option means both cannot tell
#: apart — and the widening one must never be reachable by *not* answering.
ANY_CONNECTION = "any"

#: Kinds the mapping step can create from nothing.
#:
#: A **segment** is absent on purpose: it is a saved *filter*, and inventing one
#: that matches nobody would silently change what an imported condition means.
#: A **media asset** is absent because bytes cannot be conjured — a media
#: requirement is answered with a library asset or with a URL instead.
#:
#: A **flow** is here, and it is the interesting one. A ``start_flow`` node
#: whose target the file does not carry — a single-flow export of a flow that
#: hands over to another — has no correct id to resolve to, and leaving it
#: pointing at the exporter's id is precisely the dangling reference this whole
#: module exists to prevent. So the mapping step offers to create an empty draft
#: under the name the template expected: a real flow in this workspace, visibly
#: unfinished, named after what belongs there. The dry run says so, and exporting
#: the **bundle** instead is the way to avoid the placeholder altogether.

#: ``platform`` is a member because a null connection is a legal trigger — but
#: it never reaches this set's users: :func:`_resolve` and the review template
#: both branch on it first, so "leave the trigger unbound" is a choice that has
#: to be made rather than one that happens by default. See that branch for why.
