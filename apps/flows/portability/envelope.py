"""The export envelope: its version, its caps, and the schema that guards it.

An import is **untrusted input**. A shared template arrives from a stranger, so
every check in this module happens before anything reaches the ORM, and in the
order :mod:`apps.flows.schema.envelope` established for the graph it wraps:
size, then parse, then shape, then the documents inside. Measuring or walking a
payload you have not bounded is how a hostile file becomes the denial of service
the cap was added to prevent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two versions, and why both are on the wire
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``format`` is this envelope's own version. ``schema`` is
:data:`apps.flows.schema.envelope.SCHEMA_VERSION`, the graph format the flows
inside were written against — the same integer each ``graph`` already carries in
its own ``schema`` key, repeated at the top so a reader (a human, a future
migration, a validator) can tell what it is holding without descending into it.
Neither is guessed at when it does not match: a future format wants a migration,
and a migration that never ran is worse than a refusal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`flows` is always a list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A single-flow export is a list of one. Bundle export — following ``start_flow``
and sequence-step references to their closure — then needs no second envelope
shape, so there is one schema, one validator and one importer instead of two
that drift. ``entry`` names the flow that was actually asked for, which is what
the import summary shows first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`requirements` is advisory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The manifest tells a human what a template needs. The **importer never trusts
it**: :mod:`apps.flows.portability.imports` re-derives the requirement set by
walking the graphs and trigger configs, so a document whose manifest omits a
reference cannot talk the importer into leaving one dangling. What the manifest
does supply is *labels* — the name behind a synthetic reference — which are
displayed and used as defaults, never as authority.
