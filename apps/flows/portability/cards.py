"""Template cards, as the two surfaces that show them render them.

``library.TemplateCard`` says what a shipped template *is* — a name, a summary,
the requirement kinds it walks out to. This module says how one *reads*: labels
resolved against the registries that already own them, a start URL reversed, and
the one per-workspace fact a card carries, which is whether the channel it needs
is connected.

It lives beside ``library`` rather than in a view because two views want it —
the gallery page and the flows-list empty state — and because ``library`` must
stay workspace-free: its cards are ``lru_cache``d on file content, so nothing
about a particular workspace may reach them.
