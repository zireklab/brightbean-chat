"""The starter templates shipped in the repository, and how they are found.

``flow-templates/`` at the repository root holds flow templates anybody can
import — the seed of the shared library the issue describes, and the directory a
community pull request adds to. A test validates every file in it against the
importer and imports each into a clean workspace, so a template that stops
working is a red build rather than a download that fails for a stranger.

**Not** ``templates/``: that path is Django's own ``TEMPLATES["DIRS"]``
(``config/settings/base.py``), and putting JSON documents inside the HTML
template loader's search path would be a trap for the next person who wonders
why their template name resolves to a flow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cards, and why the description is not in the file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gallery needs a sentence of English and a category per template, and the
envelope has a field for neither. It does not get one. ``f.obj`` sets
``additionalProperties: false`` on every object it builds and offers no opt-out
(``apps/flows/schema/fields.py``), so a document carrying a ``meta`` key is
refused by **every installation running today's release** — and these files are
downloaded from a repository and uploaded into other people's installs. It would
also break the byte-exact export round trip, since ``export_document`` would
never emit the key back.

So :class:`TemplateCard` **derives** every fact from the validated document —
the name from the entry flow, the platforms from the manifest's ``platform``
keys, the other requirement kinds from the rest of it — and the only
hand-written thing is :data:`TEMPLATE_COPY`, the one part no machine can infer.
Nothing that could drift is duplicated: the name on a card *is* the document's
name, and the badges *are* the manifest. Human copy in a module-level dict is
the house pattern already (``REQUIREMENT_KIND_LABELS`` in
``apps/flows/portability/cards.py``, ``FILTER_ICONS`` in
``apps/common/templatetags/common_extras.py``).

A file with no copy entry still gets a card with an empty summary, so a
self-hoster's drop-in is never invisible; a test asserts the two sets match both
ways so *ours* can never go missing.
