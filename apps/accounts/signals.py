"""Signup wiring.

One receiver, on allauth's ``user_signed_up``. See
:mod:`apps.accounts.services` for why there is no ``post_save`` receiver.

The account's language preference has no signal of its own to wire up:
``apps.accounts.middleware.LanguagePreferenceMiddleware`` reads
``request.user.language`` fresh on every request instead of trying to carry it
forward from login — this Django version has no session-based hook left for
that (``LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY`` is gone), and re-reading it is no more
expensive than the query ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` already ran to produce
``request.user``.
