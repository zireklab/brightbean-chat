"""Rate limiting on the authentication endpoints (SECURITY-BASELINE §8).

Ported from BrightBean Studio's ``AuthRateLimitMiddleware`` with three fixes.

**Trusted proxies.** Studio reads the leftmost ``X-Forwarded-For`` value
unconditionally, so any client can mint a fresh bucket per request and the
limiter stops existing. Client identity comes from
:func:`apps.common.net.get_client_ip`, which ignores the header unless the peer
is listed in ``TRUSTED_PROXIES`` (default: nothing is).

**A window that actually ends.** Studio does ``cache.get`` then ``cache.set``,
which loses concurrent increments and refreshes the TTL on every hit, so a
client under continuous load is never let back in. ``add`` + ``incr`` fixes the
first half. The second half needs the key to carry the window number, because
``BaseCache.incr`` is ``get`` + ``set`` *without* a timeout — it re-stamps the
entry with ``DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`` (five minutes), and a bucket keyed only on the
address would outlive its own window by four. Bucketing on
``now // AUTH_RATE_WINDOW`` makes the window start on the clock instead, so
``Retry-After`` is honest and the TTL only has to be long enough not to lose the
count mid-window.

A fixed window lets a client spend its allowance at the end of one window and
again at the start of the next. That is inherent to the shape and acceptable
here: this is a volume control against automated spraying, not an account
lockout.

**Shared storage.** ``CACHE_URL`` defaults to the database cache, not
``LocMemCache``: gunicorn runs two workers, and a per-process counter is evaded
by landing on the other one. See ``config/settings/base.py``.

Enumeration safety comes for free — the limiter never reads the submitted
credentials, so an existing and a non-existent account are treated identically.
It is a per-IP volume control, not per-account: a distributed spray against one
account is out of scope here.

    """Make a signed-in user's stored language win over their browser's.

    Modern Django's ``LocaleMiddleware`` resolves the active language from
    ``request.COOKIES`` (and, failing that, ``Accept-Language``) only — there is
    no session-based hook left to carry a preference forward the way older
    Django versions did with ``LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY``, which this project's
    Django version has removed entirely.

    So this reads the preference off the account instead of trying to persist
    it into a cookie at login: it runs every request, straight from
    ``request.user.language`` (``apps.accounts.models.User``), and overwrites
    whatever the browser sent before ``LocaleMiddleware`` gets to look —
    correct on a new device with no cookie yet, and correct on the family
    computer where somebody else's cookie is sitting in the jar. A blank
    preference (the field's default) changes nothing, so ``LocaleMiddleware``
    falls through to the cookie / ``Accept-Language`` exactly as it would with
    this middleware absent.

    Placed after ``AuthenticationMiddleware`` (it needs ``request.user``) and
    before ``LocaleMiddleware`` (it needs to win the race) in
    ``config/settings/base.py``'s ``MIDDLEWARE``.
