"""Connecting an email channel, and sending a test through it (SPEC §6.7).

``views_telegram._connect`` is the shape this follows, including the ordering
that makes it safe:

1. **Verify before writing.** The credentials are proved against the provider
   before a row exists, so a mistyped SMTP password or a revoked Resend key
   leaves no trace in the connection list. Telegram calls ``getMe``; each
   backend here has its own cheapest authenticated call, in
   ``email_backends.verify_credentials``.
2. **Save inside a savepoint**, so the deployment-wide unique constraint on
   ``(platform, external_id)`` comes back as a message rather than as a request
   whose transaction is already unusable.

There is no step 3. Telegram needs ``setWebhook`` because it holds the secret
itself; an email provider is configured from its own console, so this page
prints the webhook URL and the operator pastes it — which is why the URL is
built from ``settings.APP_URL`` rather than the request, and why the page says
so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
external_id is the sending domain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §5 says so, and the unique constraint on ``(platform, external_id)`` is
deployment-wide, so two workspaces cannot both claim one domain. That is the
right answer for email specifically: SPF, DKIM and DMARC are properties of a
domain, one set of DNS records governs it, and two tenants sending as the same
domain would be sharing a reputation neither controls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credentials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of them go into ``connection.credentials``, which is an encrypted JSON
column, and none of them is ever rendered back — not on a failed submit, not on
the detail page (CONTRIBUTING: "never render a stored secret"). Editing a
connection's credentials means re-entering them, which is the same trade the
Telegram flow makes.
