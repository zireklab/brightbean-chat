"""WhatsApp's connect flow and its template manager (issue #19).

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.views` because that module ships what every
platform shares — the connection row, its status, its webhook URL and secret —
and separate from :mod:`apps.channels.providers.whatsapp` because the adapter is
the thing a later platform copies and a view is not part of it. The adapter owns
the Cloud API; this module owns what an operator sees. ``views_telegram``
established the split and the reasoning is identical.

Everything here is gated on ``manage_channels``, which
``apps.members.roles._ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`` makes admin-only: these pages hold a
credential that can read and send as the business, and they submit material to
Meta under the workspace's own account.
