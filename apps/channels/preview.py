"""The "test on Telegram" flow preview (SPEC §16, issue #12).

    Preview: a "test on Telegram" action that links the editor's user to a test
    conversation and runs the draft version against it (Telegram only in v1;
    cheapest real-channel test loop).

Three moving parts, and the interesting one is the middle:

1. :func:`mint` writes a :class:`~apps.channels.models.FlowPreviewLink` and
   returns the handle that goes in the ``t.me/<bot>?start=preview-<handle>``
   deep link. The builder's Test button calls it.
2. The tester taps the link. Telegram delivers ``/start preview-<handle>``,
   which :class:`~apps.channels.providers.telegram.TelegramAdapter` parses into
   a ``referral`` event — the same event type an ordinary ref link produces,
   because that is what it is.
3. :func:`preview_events`, registered on ROADMAP contract 6's dispatch seam,
   recognises the ``preview-`` prefix, claims the link for that chat, and starts
   the flow's **draft** version.

Nothing else in the product knows the preview exists. The runner already
accepts an explicit ``flow_version`` and already sets ``execution.preview`` from
``not version.published`` (``apps.flows.engine.runner.start_flow``), so
"preview runs are excluded from stats" costs nothing here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this stage runs last
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has to follow persistence and L4-A's routing tail, twice over:

* the contact and identity this preview runs against are created by
  persistence, so running first would mean resolving them ourselves and racing
  the stage that owns them;
* routing's ``resume`` stage hands the inbound event to the contact's live
  execution. If the preview had already started one, the very ``/start`` that
  triggered the preview would immediately be offered to it as a reply — and a
  draft waiting on a button would fall straight through its own first question.

That is declared, not arranged: it registers in
:data:`apps.channels.ingest.LATE_ORDER`, so the position is a property of the
stage rather than of where its app happens to sit in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. An
earlier version of this module leaned on app-loading order instead and had to be
registered from ``apps.flows`` to get it — which put the reason for the
registration in a different app from the code.

The resulting order — ``persistence → routing → preview`` — also states the
semantics correctly: starting the draft **supersedes** whatever the event would
otherwise have done, which is what "while linked, the draft version runs" means.

#: What marks a ``/start`` payload as a preview link rather than an operator's

#: Platforms a live preview can run on, and how the tester is sent into one.
#:
#: The mechanism is a deep link carrying a ``ref`` that comes back as a referral
#: event, so a platform is in this table only if it can do both halves.
#: Messenger's ``external_id`` is the page id and ``m.me/<page-id>`` resolves;
#: Telegram and Instagram both carry a public @name in ``display_name``.
#:
#: WhatsApp, SMS and email are deliberately absent and not a gap to be filled
#: later with a token in the message body. None of them emits a referral event,
#: none has a column this app can trust to hold a dialable public handle, and a
#: token the tester has to type would mean the preview stage inspecting ordinary
#: message text — a wider claim surface than the one ``_claim`` is written
#: against, and a different threat model that would have to be argued from
#: scratch. What they get instead is an empty state that says so.

        mismatch. Failing closed here means the wrong bot sees an unrecognised
        ``/start`` payload and nothing else happens.
    ``expires_at``
        Enforced in SQL rather than after the read, so an expired link is not
        claimed on its way to being rejected.
    ``chat_id``
