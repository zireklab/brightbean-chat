"""Messenger's guided connect flow (issue #18).

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.views` for the reason issue #4 gives — the
generic frame ships the connection row, its status and its webhook URL, and each
platform's real connect flow belongs to that platform's issue — and separate from
:mod:`apps.channels.providers.messenger` because the adapter is the thing Layer 5
copies and a screen is not part of SPEC §6.1. The Graph calls this flow makes live
in :mod:`apps.channels.messenger_oauth`; this module owns what an operator sees.

Three routes and one round trip:

``messenger/connect/``
    Explains what is about to happen and what it needs. ``POST`` mints a signed
    ``state`` and sends the browser to Facebook.

``/channels/messenger/callback/``
    Where Facebook comes back. **Not** under ``/w/<workspace_id>/`` — Meta
    whitelists one exact redirect URI per app, and a per-workspace path would
    mean one whitelist entry per tenant. The workspace comes from the signed
    state instead, and the signed-in user's permission on *that* workspace is
    checked before anything else happens.

``messenger/pages/``
    Pick which page to connect. ``POST`` writes the connection, subscribes the
    webhook fields and configures the Get Started button.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is held between the two halves, and how
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The callback ends holding a long-lived **user** access token, and the page the
operator has not chosen yet needs it. So it is carried in the session — which is
database-backed and server-side here (``SESSION_ENGINE`` is the db backend), never
a cookie — and it is carried **encrypted**, with the same AES-256-GCM utility
every credential column uses, because SECURITY-BASELINE §5 says tokens live in
encrypted fields and ``django_session.session_data`` is a plain column.

It is deleted the moment a page is chosen, the moment the chooser finds it too
old (:data:`PENDING_MAX_AGE`), and the moment the connect page is opened again —
that last one because nothing sweeps the session on its own, so without it an
abandoned attempt would keep a live token for the session's own 14-day life
instead of for fifteen minutes. **Page** tokens are never held at all: the chooser
re-reads ``/me/accounts`` on the POST, so the credential that ends up on the
connection has existed only inside one request.
