"""Turning an inbound ``media_id`` into bytes a browser can show.

Two adapters store an identifier in ``EventPayload.media_ids`` rather than a URL
in ``EventPayload.attachments``, and both for the same reason: the address the
platform gave us needs *our* credentials to fetch. Telegram hands out a
``file_id`` that only becomes a URL after a ``getFile`` call, and the URL it
becomes expires in an hour. Twilio hands out a ``MediaUrl`` addressing a REST
resource under the account, which answers 401 to anyone without the Account SID
and Auth Token — or, on an account without authenticated media, answers to
anyone at all, which is a contact's picture messages behind a link we would be
handing out.

Neither is an attachment, and neither is something the inbox can put in a
``src``. This module is the one path from an identifier to displayable bytes,
and it has three parts:

:meth:`apps.channels.providers.base.Adapter.media_source`
    The platform-specific half, because only the adapter knows whether
    resolution means a ``getFile`` call, a Basic-auth GET, or something else. It
    returns *where to fetch and with what headers*, not the bytes: the fetch
    itself is the same on every platform and belongs here.

:func:`fetch_media`
    The shared half. One guarded request, one sniff, one decision about how the
    result may be served.

:func:`media_response`
    The response, built to SECURITY-BASELINE §9.

**Why the fetch goes through the SSRF guard.** SECURITY-BASELINE §6 puts
"media fetch-by-URL" on ``apps.common.outbound.guarded_request`` by name, and
there is a real question to answer here because the sibling helper,
``apps.channels.providers.base.request_json``, exists precisely for URLs an
adapter builds from constants and stored ids. The distinction is where the
*variable part* of the URL came from. A Twilio ``MediaUrl`` arrives inside a
webhook body, so it is contact-supplied and the guard is not optional. A
Telegram file URL is assembled by us, but its path comes from a ``getFile``
response, which is still somebody else's string. §6 ends with "a call site that
cannot tell which of the two it is wants the guard", so every download here
takes the guard — one call site, one rule, and ``tests/ssrf.py``'s
``guard_required()`` can be wrapped around the whole of :func:`fetch_media`.

The platform *API* call an adapter makes to resolve an id — Telegram's
``getFile`` — is the other case and keeps using ``request_json``: fixed host,
built from constants and a stored token.

**What is served back.** SECURITY-BASELINE §9's rules are not about the media
library specifically, they are about anything this deployment serves from its
own origin, and inbound media is the more hostile of the two sources: an upload
came from a team member, this came from a stranger. So the content type is
**sniffed** from the bytes with :mod:`apps.media_library.mimes` — the same
allowlist, deliberately not a second one — and anything that is not a safe
inline image is served ``Content-Disposition: attachment`` with ``nosniff``.
Bytes the sniffer does not recognise are served as ``application/octet-stream``
rather than rejected: a thread that hides an attachment it cannot name is worse
for the reader than one that offers a download, and an attachment disposition
already makes it inert.

**Why there is no signed token.** The two obvious precedents are
``apps.common.signing`` and ``apps.media_library.delivery``, and both were read
before this module was written. ``delivery`` mints a signed, unguessable,
never-expiring token because — in its own words — "a platform fetching an image
has no session and no workspace", so the token has to *be* the credential.
The consumer here is the opposite: a team member's browser, on our own origin,
holding a session and a workspace. So the route
(``inbox:media``) is an ordinary authenticated, workspace-scoped view, and
SECURITY-BASELINE §4 — which governs *unauthenticated* token routes — does not
apply to it. Two properties a token would have bought are bought better without
one:

*unguessability*
    Replaced by the membership check. A signed URL that anyone holding it can
    replay is a weaker control than one that 404s for everybody outside the
    workspace, and a URL leaks (history, referrers, a screenshot) far more
    easily than a session does.

*provenance*
    The media id is read out of the stored ``Message.body`` by row id and block
    index, never taken from the request. That is what stops this module from
    becoming an oracle that fetches *arbitrary* ids with a connection's
    credentials — a stronger guarantee than "we signed this once", and it comes
    from the query rather than from a secret.

**Cost, and the two things that bound it.** Nothing is cached server-side, so a
fetch that happens is a live call to the platform — on Telegram, two of them.
That matters more than it looks: this deployment ships four request slots (see
the time budget below), so every concurrent fetch is a quarter of the web tier
held for the duration.

The route is therefore *conditional*. ``apps.inbox.views.media`` tags each
response with an ETag over the row and the block position, and answers a
revalidation with 304 **before** calling anything here. The content at a given
``(message, block index)`` is immutable — an inbound row is never rewritten — so
that tag is stable and the 304 is always correct. Combined with
``Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600`` and a URL that does not change between
renders, a reader who scrolls back through a thread pays for each attachment
once rather than once per render.

A stored copy — resolve once into the media library — is still the better
answer for a busy deployment, and is deliberately not this change.

# The time budget
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **This runs on a web worker, and that is the whole constraint.** The
# Dockerfile starts ``gunicorn --workers 2 --threads 2`` and
# docker-compose.prod.yml four workers, neither with a ``--timeout`` — so the
# deployment has *four to eight* concurrent request slots and gunicorn's
# default 30-second worker timeout. A request that outlives that
# budget is not slow, it is a SIGKILL that takes every other request sharing the
# worker down with it.
#
# So the two halves of a resolution are budgeted together and the sum is stated
# here rather than left for someone to add up:
#
#     resolve (adapter, e.g. getFile)   5 s
#     download (guarded_request)       10 s
#     ---------------------------------------
#     worst case                       15 s   — half of gunicorn's 30 s
#
# An earlier version let the adapter use ``BACKGROUND_TIMEOUT`` (30 s) for the
# resolve step, on the reasoning that "nothing is waiting but an ``<img>``".
# That was wrong twice over: a Django worker is waiting, and 30 + 20 exceeded
# the worker timeout outright.

#: Wall clock for the adapter's own resolution call — Telegram's ``getFile``,
#: or whatever a platform needs to turn an identifier into an address. Adapters
#: import this rather than choosing their own, so the arithmetic above stays
#: true when a second platform lands.
MEDIA_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT = 5.0

#: Wall clock for the download itself, enforced by the guard as a deadline
#: across every redirect hop and every chunk of the body.
MEDIA_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 10.0

#: Default ceiling on a single attachment, when the deployment sets none.
#: Generous next to the guard's own 1 MB because that default is sized for JSON
#: API responses and this is a photograph, and bounded because the whole body is
#: buffered: the guard's cap is an *allocation* bound, so this number times the
#: number of concurrent readers is memory this process will actually hold.
DEFAULT_MAX_MEDIA_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024

#: What a sniff that recognises nothing becomes. Paired with ``attachment`` and

UNKNOWN_MIME = "application/octet-stream"

#: How a resolved attachment may be cached. ``private`` because it is one
#: workspace's contact's file and a shared cache in front of the deployment must
#: never hold it. Named rather than inlined because the route sets it on a 304
#: as well, and the two must agree — a revalidation answering with a different
#: policy than the response it is revalidating is how an entry gets dropped.
