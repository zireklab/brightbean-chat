"""Channel connections and the raw webhook event log (SPEC §5).

Two tables with deliberately different tenancy:

:class:`ChannelConnection` is tenant data — a workspace's bot, page or number,
holding the credentials that are this deployment's crown jewels — so it inherits
:class:`~apps.common.scoping.WorkspaceScopedModel` and its querysets refuse to
run unscoped.

:class:`WebhookEventLog` hangs off the connection and carries no workspace
column, which is what SPEC §5 specifies (it is listed under "webhooks and API",
not with the tenant tables). That is also what keeps the scoping guard off the
webhook hot path: the request that writes these rows has no authenticated user
and therefore no workspace to scope by, and reaching for ``.unscoped()`` on
every inbound event would make the greppable escape hatch meaningless.

**The webhook secret is stored twice, on purpose.** ``webhook_secret`` is
encrypted at rest and is what an operator pastes into a provider console.
``webhook_secret_digest`` is the queryable HMAC of the same value, because
encrypted columns cannot be filtered — every write uses a fresh nonce, so
``.filter(webhook_secret=value)`` compares two unrelated ciphertexts and
silently matches nothing (see ``apps.common.encryption``). Telegram presents its
secret in a header and the connection has to be found *by* it, which is exactly
the case ``apps/credentials/models.py`` predicted this issue would be the first
to hit.

**WhatsApp's two tables live here too** (issue #19). SPEC §5 files
``whatsapp_template`` under "messaging", but ``apps.messaging`` is the one app
ROADMAP contract 4 keeps free of platform names — the compliance engine's whole
design is that a platform costs a policy row and never a branch — and the table
hangs off a :class:`ChannelConnection` rather than off a conversation. The
*behaviour* is not here: submitting, polling and rendering a template is
:mod:`apps.channels.whatsapp_templates`, so this module stays what it says it
is.

    ``ContactChannelIdentity.opted_out_at`` already answers "did this identity
    withdraw consent?", and for an unsubscribe it is set too. It cannot be the
    whole answer, because of a decision made two apps away:
    ``apps/contacts/imports.py`` **never fabricates an identity** — "a spreadsheet
    column is not consent" — and ``imports._match`` deliberately skips deleted
    contacts. So a contact that goes away and comes back is a brand-new
    ``Contact`` row, and the opt-out is out of its reach two different ways:

    * ``delete_contact`` is a *soft* delete, so the old identity survives — but
      it belongs to a tombstone, and identities resolve **by contact**, so the
      re-imported contact has none and cannot be given one (the
      ``(connection, address)`` unique constraint is already taken).
    * A **hard** delete — issue #29's GDPR erasure, or a merge — takes the
      identity with it, and every trace of the opt-out goes too.

    A bounce is not a fact about a contact row. It is a fact about a **mailbox**:
    that address rejected mail, or its owner marked us as spam, and neither
    stops being true because somebody re-uploaded a spreadsheet. So the key is
    the normalised address and there is deliberately no foreign key to
    ``Contact`` — a cascade from one would delete exactly the record that has to
    survive.

    Workspace-scoped rather than deployment-wide, for the reason
    ``messaging.models``' pending-identity constraint gives for the same choice:
    two workspaces may legitimately both hold the same address, they send from
    different domains, and one tenant's bounce is not evidence about another's
    relationship with that mailbox.

    **Enforcement** is in ``apps.channels.providers.email``, immediately before
    the wire, and a hit there also opts the identity out through the messaging
    facade — so the *second* send to a re-imported suppressed address is refused
    by the compliance engine (SPEC §19's chokepoint) rather than by the adapter,
    and every set-wise consumer sees it too.

    SPEC §16 asks for "a test on Telegram action that links the editor's user to
    a test conversation and runs the draft version against it". This row is that
    link, and it exists because the binding has to survive the round trip out
    through Telegram and back: the builder mints it, the tester taps a ``t.me``
    link, and the ``/start`` that arrives seconds later is the first time the
    server learns which chat belongs to which editor.

    **Why a handle and not a signed token.** SECURITY-BASELINE §4 puts every
    unauthenticated token route on ``apps.common.signing``, and issue #12's own
    wording is ``?start=preview-<signed token>``. Telegram makes that impossible:
    a deep-link ``start`` payload is capped at **64 characters** and restricted
    to ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]``, while a ``django.core.signing`` token is longer than
    that and contains ``:`` and ``.``. So the link carries a 32-character random
    handle instead, and this row carries everything the token would have.

    Every property the baseline is protecting survives the substitution:

    expiry
        ``expires_at``, checked on use. Shorter than a signed token's typical
        life, not longer.
    constant-time verification
        The handle is looked up by ``hmac_digest``, an equality match on a
        fixed-length column — the same construction ``ChannelConnection``
        already uses for its webhook secret, and for the same reason: an
        encrypted column cannot be filtered.
    generic failure
        Nothing about a bad handle is distinguishable from a good one that has
        expired, or from an unrecognised ``/start`` payload. A failed preview
        does not answer, log a distinct reason, or behave differently in any way
        an outsider can see (:mod:`apps.channels.preview`).
    unguessable
        192 bits of ``secrets.token_urlsafe``, and the digest is keyed on
        ``SECRET_KEY``, so a database dump gives up neither the handles nor the
        ability to recompute one.

    **Isolation per tester** is ``chat_id``. It is empty until the first
    ``/start`` claims the link, and the claim is a conditional UPDATE rather
    than a read followed by a write, so two chats racing the same handle cannot
    both win. Afterwards only that chat can use the link again, which is what
    keeps one editor's preview out of another person's conversation.

    """One WhatsApp message template, ours and Meta's copy of it (SPEC §6.5).

    Outside the 24-hour window a WhatsApp send needs one of these and nothing
    else will do — ``apps.messaging.compliance`` answers ``NeedsTemplate`` from
    ``PlatformPolicy`` alone, with no knowledge that this table exists. That
    separation is the point: the *decision* is policy data, and this is the
    material that satisfies it.

    **Workspace-scoped, though SPEC §5 lists only the connection FK.** Every
    read here happens in a settings page or a composer that already knows its
    workspace, and CONTRIBUTING makes the enforcing manager the rule for tenant
    data rather than something each view remembers. The connection FK is still
    the authoritative link — a template belongs to the WABA it was submitted to.

    **What keeps the two from disagreeing is the write path, not a ``clean``.**
    An earlier version of this docstring promised one, and a ``clean`` here
    could not have delivered it anyway: ``workspace`` is not a form field and is
    assigned after ``form.is_valid()``, so ``ModelForm._post_clean`` would run
    the model's validation before the value it was meant to check exists. What
    holds instead is that both sides are forced to the same workspace on every
    write — ``views_whatsapp._edit`` loads through ``get_scoped_object_or_404``,
    ``WhatsAppTemplateForm`` narrows the ``channel_connection`` choices to that
    workspace, and the view then assigns ``workspace`` itself. Every reader
    fails closed regardless: ``whatsapp_templates.sendable`` and
    ``approved_templates_for`` both filter on workspace *and* connection, so a
    row that ever did disagree would be unsendable and invisible rather than
    reachable from the wrong tenant.

    ``body_structure`` is the authored template, in the shape
    :mod:`apps.channels.whatsapp_templates` translates into Graph components::

        {
          "header": {"format": "text", "text": "Order {{1}}"},   # optional
          "body":   {"text": "Hi {{1}}, your order shipped."},
          "footer": {"text": "Reply STOP to opt out."},           # optional
          "buttons": [{"type": "quick_reply", "text": "Track"},
                      {"type": "url", "text": "Open", "url": "https://x.test/{{1}}"}]
        }

    The ``{{n}}`` placeholders are Meta's own numbering, and they are filled by
    the one shared renderer (SECURITY-BASELINE §3) — never by a template engine.
