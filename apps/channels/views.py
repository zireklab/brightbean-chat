"""Workspace settings → Channels (SPEC §5, issue #4).

Admin-only: ``manage_channels`` is one of ``_ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`` in
``apps.members.roles``, and this page mints the secret a platform authenticates
with.

**Minimal by design.** The issue says so — "per-platform placeholder connect
panels (real flows arrive with each adapter)" — and the reason is that each
platform's connect flow is genuinely different: a BotFather token pasted into a
field, a Meta OAuth round trip, Twilio credentials plus a number. Building one
form that pretends they are the same shape means building it wrong six times.
What ships here is the frame every adapter will hang its flow on: the row, its
status, its webhook URL and its secret.

**The webhook secret is shown exactly once.** It is rendered in the response to
the POST that created or rotated it, and never again — no redirect, no
``messages`` framework. That is not fussiness: ``messages`` is stored in the
session, which for this project is a database table, so a redirect-then-show
would leave a live platform credential sitting in ``django_session`` in plain
text for the life of the session (SECURITY-BASELINE §5). Post/Redirect/Get is
worth giving up for that; the double-submit it protects against would just mint
another secret.

#: BotFather token is one field and Meta's Cloud API is three plus a
#: subscription. The list page used to carry Telegram's wording inline, which
#: silently became wrong for the second platform that got a flow.
#:
#: **Every entry in ``CONNECT_ROUTES`` needs one**, and that pairing is asserted
#: by ``test_views.py`` rather than left to whoever adds the next adapter. It
#: has been missed twice already — Instagram's flow and SMS's each landed on
#: main while this dict was being edited on another branch, and each merge
#: produced a row reading "set it up — " with nothing after the dash. Neither
#: branch could see it alone, which is exactly what a test is for.
#:
#: Each is a whole sentence and is capitalised as one. They used to be
#: continuations of "Telegram — set it up — …", so they read correctly only in
#: that one line of markup; the moment the page grew a card layout they became
