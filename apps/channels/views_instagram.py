"""Instagram's guided connect flow and the comment trigger's post picker (issue #17).

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.views` because the frame and the flow are
different things — that module ships the connection row, its status and its
webhook URL, and issue #4's docstring is explicit that each platform's real
connect flow belongs to that platform's own issue.

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.providers.instagram` because the adapter is the
thing four more platforms copy and a view is not part of it. The adapter owns the
Graph API; this module owns what an operator sees. The token exchange itself is a
third thing again, in :mod:`apps.channels.instagram_oauth`.

Three routes:

``instagram/connect/``
    Workspace-scoped, ``manage_channels``. Explains what will happen, then sends
    the operator to Meta with a signed ``state``.

``/channels/instagram/callback/``
    **Not** workspace-scoped, and it cannot be: Meta matches a redirect URI
    against the app's configuration exactly, so one app has one callback URL for
    the whole deployment. The workspace travels in the signed ``state`` and is
    re-authorised here, against the signed-in user, before anything is exchanged
    or written.

``instagram/posts/``
    The post picker for SPEC §10's comment trigger. ``edit_flows`` rather than
    ``manage_channels``, for the same reason ``telegram_preview`` is: the person
    using it is a flow author who may well not administer channels, and it reads
    the connection without changing anything about it.
