"""Testing a draft on the channel it was built for (SPEC §16, extended).

SPEC §16 scoped the preview to Telegram — "cheapest real-channel test loop" —
and that is what shipped. The cost showed up the first time somebody built an
Instagram comment-to-DM automation: the only way to see their own flow was to
publish it to real customers.

The mechanism generalises cleanly to the two other platforms that can carry a
``ref`` into a referral event, and everything downstream of the link was already
platform-agnostic: ``preview._claim`` binds on the connection, and ``chat_id``
holds a PSID or an IGSID as happily as a Telegram chat id.

It does **not** generalise to WhatsApp, SMS or email, and this module does not
pretend otherwise. See ``preview.PREVIEW_LINKS`` for why, and note that the
honest answer — an explained empty state naming the platform — is a better
outcome than a token the tester has to paste into a message body.

Which platform is offered comes from the flow's own triggers, which is what
"the channel you built it for" means. A flow with only an Instagram trigger is
not handed a Telegram link just because a bot happens to be connected.
