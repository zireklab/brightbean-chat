"""Telegram's connect flow and the builder's "test on Telegram" link (issue #12).

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.views` because the frame and the flow are
different things. ``views.py`` ships what every platform shares — the connection
row, its status, its webhook URL and secret — and issue #4's docstring is
explicit that each platform's real connect flow belongs to that platform's own
issue, because "a BotFather token pasted into a field, a Meta OAuth round trip,
Twilio credentials plus a number" are not one form.

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.providers.telegram` because the adapter is the
thing Layer 5 copies and a view is not part of it. The adapter owns the Bot API;
this module owns what an operator sees.

Two routes:

``telegram/connect/``
    Paste a token, and we do the rest: ``getMe`` to prove it and learn the bot's
    identity, then a connection row, then ``setWebhook`` with a freshly minted
    secret. Nothing is stored until the token is known good.

The flow builder's preview used to live here too. It is now
``apps.channels.views_preview``, because which platform it opens is the flow's
own triggers' answer rather than a Telegram fact — ``BOT_USERNAME`` below is
what it still borrows from this module.
