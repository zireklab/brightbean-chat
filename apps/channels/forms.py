"""Forms for connection management.

Deliberately small. Issue #4 ships the platform-agnostic frame — a connection
row, its status and its webhook secret — and every real connect flow (a
BotFather token, a Meta OAuth round trip, Twilio credentials) belongs to the
adapter issue for that platform. A form here that asked for credentials would be
guessing at six different shapes and would have to be replaced six times.
