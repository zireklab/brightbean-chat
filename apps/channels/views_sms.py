"""Twilio's connect flow, the workspace's SMS settings, and the segment preview.

Separate from :mod:`apps.channels.views` because the frame and the flow are
different things, and separate from :mod:`apps.channels.providers.sms` because
the adapter is what a later platform copies and a view is not part of it — the
same split ``views_telegram`` made and for the same reasons. Issue #4's own
docstring named "Twilio credentials plus a number" as one of the three shapes a
generic form could not have collected.

Three routes:

``sms/connect/``
    Account SID, auth token, and a from-number **or** a messaging service.
    Everything is validated against Twilio before a row is written, so a wrong
    credential leaves no trace.

``sms/settings/``
    SPEC §6.6's configurable copy — the HELP reply and the two confirmations —
    plus a per-segment cost hint and the A2P 10DLC checklist. Nothing here can
    weaken the compliance behaviour; see :class:`~apps.channels.models.SmsSettings`.

``sms/segments/``
    The segment-count preview, an HTMX fragment over the pure function in
    :mod:`apps.channels.segments`. POST rather than GET because the thing being
    counted is message text, and a GET would put a draft broadcast in a URL,
    an access log and a browser history.
