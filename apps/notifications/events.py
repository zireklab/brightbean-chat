"""The event-type registry — this app's whole vocabulary.

Studio spells its event types as a ``TextChoices`` enum on an indexed
``CharField``. That works while one team owns every event, and stops working
here: issue #7 ships eight types for consumers that land in Layers 3 to 6, and
each of those layers will want its own. With ``choices=`` on the column, every
one of them is a schema migration in *this* app authored by *another* agent —
for a constraint Django enforces in forms and not in the database.

So the column is a plain ``CharField`` and this module is the vocabulary. It is
**additive**: a later app registers from its own ``AppConfig.ready()`` and never
edits this file.

Registration also carries the *copy*. :func:`~apps.notifications.engine.notify`
takes only a ``context`` dict — no title, no body — so the wording of an event
lives in one place instead of being retyped at every call site, and rewording an
alert is an edit here rather than a hunt through Layer 3.

Copy templates are :meth:`str.format_map` strings rather than Django templates,
which sidesteps a trap: a Django template renders with autoescaping *on*, so
``Ben & Jerry's`` would be stored in the ``title`` column as
``Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s`` and then escaped a second time by ``{{ n.title }}``
at display time. These columns hold plain text and are escaped once, where they
are shown. The format strings are first-party Python; only the substituted
values come from the world, and they are inert.
