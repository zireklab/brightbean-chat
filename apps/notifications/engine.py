The issue writes this helper as ``notifications.notify(...)``. It is **not**
re-exported from ``apps/notifications/__init__.py``: every app package in this
repo has an empty ``__init__``, and Django imports app packages during
``apps.populate()`` — before the model registry exists — so a package-level
``from .engine import notify`` would drag models in and raise
``AppRegistryNotReady``. ``from apps.notifications.engine import notify`` is the
public import, which is also what Studio's own module docstring instructs.

There are no callers in this issue. Layers 3 to 6 supply them.

    Recipients come from exactly one of two places:

    * ``users`` — an explicit list. Deduplicated, deactivated accounts dropped.
      ``users=[]`` means **nobody**, and is deliberately distinguishable from
      ``users=None``: an empty recipient list quietly turning into "all admins"
      is the failure mode worth being strict about.
    * ``roles`` — resolved against ``workspace``. Defaults to
      ``("admin",)``, which is SPEC §9.2's "notify workspace admins".

    Passing both is a ``TypeError`` in every environment. It is a call-signature
    error rather than a runtime condition, so it does not go through the
    DEBUG-raise/production-log policy that unknown event types do. Both
    parameters default to ``None`` rather than ``roles`` defaulting to
    ``("admin",)`` directly, because that is what makes "both were given"
    detectable at all.

    Returns the created rows, in recipient order. A count is strictly less
    information (``len()`` recovers it) and ``None`` would force every caller
    and test to re-query.

    No transaction is opened here on purpose. The flow engine (SPEC §9.6) runs
    inside one, and a notification must not be able to roll back a flow step.
    The synchronous email send is deferred with ``transaction.on_commit`` so a
    caller whose transaction *does* roll back has not already mailed anyone; the
    enqueue path needs no such guard, because the queue row is written in the
    same transaction and rolls back with it.
