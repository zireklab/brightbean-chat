"""Sending one notification email.

Follows the house pattern set by ``apps.members.services.send_invite_email``:
subject built in Python, the ``.txt`` body as the message body with the
``.html`` attached as an alternative, ``settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` as the
sender, and absolute URLs built from ``settings.APP_URL``.

It also copies that function's **narrow** exception clause, which is the part
worth copying deliberately. ``except Exception`` here would report a
``TemplateSyntaxError`` or a renamed context key as a mail-delivery problem and
then swallow it: the delivery row would read ``failed`` with an SMTP-shaped
message, and every notification email in the deployment would be silently
missing. Only transport errors are caught.
