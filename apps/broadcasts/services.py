"""Composing, scheduling, cancelling and settling a broadcast (SPEC §13).

Everything that mutates a broadcast lives here; the views translate a request
into one of these calls and render the result. Three parts are worth reading
before changing anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The content is a real flow, kept out of the way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §5 gives a broadcast ``flow_id`` **or** ``whatsapp_template_id``. The
mini-flow half is a genuine ``flows.Flow`` holding a single-node ``graph_json``
(ROADMAP line 43: "HTMX composer (single-node graph_json — no React embed)"),
written through ``apps.flows.services.save_draft`` so it goes through the same
sanitiser every other graph does.

It lives in a reserved folder, :data:`BROADCAST_FOLDER`, so the flow list groups
every broadcast's private copy under one heading an operator can filter away —
and it is **archived when the broadcast finishes**, which takes it out of that
list altogether (``apps.flows.views._visible_flows`` excludes archived flows by
default). Archiving it any earlier is not an option: ``start_flow`` refuses an
archived flow outright, which is the right rule for the engine and the reason the
timing here is what it is. Neither half needs a column added to ``apps.flows`` or
that app learning what a broadcast is.

:func:`schedule_broadcast` **publishes** it and pins the published version. The
foreign key alone would not be enough: ``apps.flows.services.save_draft`` rewrites
the latest version *in place* while it is unpublished, so an edit during a drain
would change the copy the rest of the audience receives. Publishing is what makes
the next edit open a new version instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refusals are values, not exceptions to swallow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:class:`BroadcastError` is raised for everything an operator can fix — an empty
audience, a Messenger send with no tag, a graph that will not validate — and the
views turn it into a toast. It is a ``ValueError`` subclass so a caller that
forgets is still not going to mistake it for success.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counters come from the rows, not from a running total
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:func:`counters` is two aggregate queries over ``BroadcastRecipient``, both
served by the ``(broadcast, status)`` index. ``stats`` is written back only when
it changed — SPEC §13.2's "updated in batches" — so a page polling every three
seconds does not put an UPDATE on a GET.

    "No recipient is pending" is **not** the same question as "this broadcast is

    hundred contacts at a time; between two chunks the rows written so far can
    all reach a terminal state, and a broadcast settled at that moment is marked
    ``sent`` — after which the next chunk reads that status and returns without
    expanding the rest. Nine thousand five hundred people never hear from it, the
    counters read complete, and ``broadcast.finished`` has already gone out.

    The window is not theoretical. A chunk that raises — a deadlock, a dropped
    connection, an ``IntegrityError`` from ``schedule()`` — is retried on SPEC
    §15's ladder, and thirty seconds is long enough for a chunk's worth of sends
    to drain. ``settle_broadcasts`` walks into the same state from the other side
    by reconciling stranded recipients and then settling.

    ``failed`` counts as outstanding too, and that is the deliberate half. A
    chunk can fail permanently — deleting a tag the audience filter names makes
    every remaining chunk raise ``ConditionValidationError`` until the retry
    budget is spent — and the audience is then demonstrably not fully expanded.
    A broadcast left at ``sending`` beside a red queue row is a state an operator
    can see and act on; one marked ``sent`` after reaching five per cent of its
    audience is a silent lie, and ``cancelled`` is the exit that already exists.

    ``exclude_action_id`` is for the fanout handler itself: the row it is running
