"""Broadcasts and their recipients — SPEC §5's ``broadcast``, SPEC §13.

Two tables. :class:`Broadcast` is the thing an operator composes; SPEC §5 fixes
its columns and this module adds nothing to them that is not bookkeeping.
:class:`BroadcastRecipient` is one row per targeted contact, and it is the part
worth explaining because SPEC only asks for a ``stats`` json.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why a recipient row rather than counters on the broadcast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §13.2 wants live counters "from stats json (updated in batches)". The
tempting implementation — every ``broadcast_send`` handler incrementing a
counter on the broadcast row — does not survive contact with the worker:
``apps.queueing.worker.process_action`` wraps each handler in one
``transaction.atomic()``, so a row-level lock taken inside it is **held across
the provider call**. Ten thousand sends would then serialise behind one row for
the length of ten thousand HTTP round trips.

A recipient row is the send's own row, so there is no contention at all, and
three other things fall out of it:

* the acceptance criterion ``queued = sent + failed + cancelled + skipped``
  reconciles by construction, because every term is a count of these rows;
* ``unique (broadcast, contact)`` makes fanout re-entrant independently of the
  queue's idempotency key, which is what a forced worker retry needs (SPEC §21);
* ``message`` gives delivered/read for free from the column
  ``apps.messaging.ingest`` already advances when a delivery receipt arrives —
  so this app needs no second receipt path and no edit to ``apps.messaging``.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is a flow **or** a template, never both
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §5: "message flow_id OR whatsapp_template_id". The mini-flow is a real
``flows.Flow`` carrying a single-node graph, kept ``archived`` so it stays out of
the flow list, and the version is **pinned** on the broadcast when it is
scheduled — an edit to the graph mid-send must not change what the rest of the
audience receives. A check constraint holds the exclusive-or rather than a
service remembering it.
