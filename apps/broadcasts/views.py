"""The broadcast pages: list, composer wizard and the live detail (SPEC §13).

Everything is gated on ``send_broadcasts``, reads included. A broadcast page
shows an audience and its compliance verdicts, which is the same material the
CRM gates behind ``manage_crm`` — and the placeholder route this replaces was
already gated on that key, so the permission a member needs to reach
``/broadcasts/`` does not change with this issue.

Decorator order is CONTRIBUTING.md's, outermost first, and it is load-bearing:
``@require_POST`` innermost means a cross-tenant GET answers 404 rather than 405,
and a 405 would confirm the route and the object exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wizard is four server-rendered steps, not a client state machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §13.1's four steps — channel, audience, content, schedule — are four
partials. Each one's form posts to its own endpoint, which saves through
:mod:`apps.broadcasts.services` and answers with the *next* step's markup. The
step an operator lands on is derived from what the row already holds, so a
half-finished draft reopens where it was left and nothing about "where am I" is
kept in the browser.

The audience step embeds ``templates/contacts/_filter_bar.html`` and
``apps.contacts.builder.builder_config`` verbatim — the payload module L6-C
extracted when the inbox-rule editor became the second page to render that
builder. A second condition builder here would be a second list of sources and
operators, and the whole point of contract 8 is that a broadcast audience, an
inbox rule and a saved segment agree by construction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The detail page polls, and 304s
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §14's transport, reused: :func:`counters` computes the figures, builds a
weak ETag **out of them**, and hands both to ``apps.common.polling.conditional``.
The counters *are* the state, so an unchanged poll never renders the fragment it
would have thrown away. The client half — htmx does not send ``If-None-Match``,
and htmx 2 swaps on 304 unless told not to — lives in ``templates/broadcasts/``
and is the same code ``templates/inbox/list.html`` documents.
