"""The in-app notification a finished broadcast produces (issue #7's engine).

Registered from this app's ``ready()`` rather than added to
``apps/notifications/events.py``, which is what that module's docstring invites:
"a later app registers from its own AppConfig.ready() and never edits this file".

``emails_by_default=False``. ``NotificationEvent``'s own rule is that an event
nobody can act on from their inbox does not earn an email — and the answer to
"your broadcast finished" is to open the page and read the counters, which is
one click from the bell and several from a mailbox.
