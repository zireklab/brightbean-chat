"""Every write to the library goes through here.

One chokepoint per operation, so the upload policy — sniff, then size, then
quota — is stated once and cannot drift between the browser surface and the
picker-driven surfaces that later issues add. Studio learned the same lesson the
hard way and says so in its own ``create_asset`` docstring; the difference here
is that the ordering is explicit and the quota is taken under a row lock.

Storage writes happen *before* the database transaction, not inside it. The
alternative — holding the workspace row lock across an S3 PUT — serialises every
upload in a workspace behind the slowest one, and a 200 MB video makes that
visible. The cost of this ordering is a possible orphaned object when the quota
check rejects, so the reject path deletes it, best-effort and without letting a
cleanup failure mask the real error.
