"""Folders and assets — both tenant models (SPEC §5, SECURITY-BASELINE §1).

Studio's ``MediaAsset`` carries a nullable ``workspace`` so an organization can
hold a shared library above its workspaces. That shape cannot survive here:
:class:`~apps.common.scoping.WorkspaceScopedModel`'s ``workspace`` foreign key
is not nullable, and ``for_workspace(None)`` raises rather than quietly
filtering on ``IS NULL``. The org tier is therefore dropped (it is an agency
feature, and all four downstream consumers — the flow builder, broadcasts, the
inbox and the email editor — are workspace-scoped), and every asset belongs to
exactly one workspace, inside the enforcing manager.

Also not ported, because issue #16 does not ask for them: version history, the
crop/rotate/trim editor, starring, Unsplash attribution and the per-platform
``processed_variants`` blob. What is kept is the part the send path needs — a
stable id, the real content type, and enough metadata to render a picker.
