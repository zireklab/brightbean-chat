"""Size limits, per file and per workspace (SECURITY-BASELINE §9).

Studio resolves a per-*organization* cap through subscription tiers and an
override row in a settings table. None of that machinery is here and none of it
is wanted: this is a self-hostable product, so the limits are environment
variables with defaults that fit a small box, and the tenant boundary they are
counted against is the workspace — the same boundary everything else in the app
is scoped to.

**Storage is deliberately not an entitlement**, and that survived the arrival of
:mod:`apps.billing`. Disk is the operator's own cost on their own box, so it
belongs to whoever pays for the box rather than to a plan — a self-hoster tuning
``MEDIA_WORKSPACE_QUOTA_BYTES`` is configuring their hardware, not buying
something. The free plan's limits are the four things a reader can see on the
billing page: contacts reached, channels, automations and seats.

Two independent limits, because they stop different things. The per-file cap
(by kind, since a video is legitimately larger than an avatar) bounds what a
single request can cost. The per-workspace cap bounds what a member can
accumulate over a thousand of them.
