"""What an upload actually is, decided from its bytes (SECURITY-BASELINE §9).

"Content type determined by **sniffing**, not extension." Both of the values a
client supplies about a file — the multipart ``Content-Type`` header and the
filename's extension — are attacker-chosen and neither is consulted anywhere in
this app. :func:`sniff` reads the first :data:`HEAD_BYTES` and matches them
against an allowlist of magic-byte signatures; anything it does not recognise is
rejected outright rather than stored as "unknown".

That ordering is the whole defence. The attack it stops is stored XSS: upload an
HTML document called ``logo.png`` with ``Content-Type: image/png``, then get a
victim's browser to render it from the deployment's own origin. Studio's
sniffer already refuses that; this module adds the reasons — a rejection says
*why* — and the :data:`INLINE_SAFE_MIMES` set that decides which types the
delivery view is willing to serve with ``Content-Disposition: inline``.

The allowlist is deliberately narrow: images, audio, video and PDF. SVG is
absent on purpose (it is a script-carrying document that browsers render), and
so are the zip-based office formats. Widening the ``file`` kind is a separate
change with its own review, not a line appended here.
