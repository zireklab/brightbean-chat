"""The CRM core: contacts, tags, custom fields and segments (SPEC §5).

Every model here is tenant data, so every one inherits
:class:`apps.common.scoping.WorkspaceScopedModel` — including the two join
tables. ``contact_tag`` and ``custom_field_value`` carry a ``workspace`` column
that SPEC §5 does not list, and it is not redundant bookkeeping: the condition
engine filters them inside correlated ``Exists()`` subqueries, and a subquery is
*compiled* rather than executed, so ``WorkspaceScopedQuerySet``'s guard never
fires on one (:mod:`apps.contacts.conditions` explains at length). Carrying the
column means those subqueries can be scoped for real instead of resting on a
join back to ``contact``.

Deliberately **not** here:

* ``contact_channel_identity`` — SPEC §5 files it under contacts, but it hangs
  off a channel connection, so it lands with the messaging spine (issue #8).
* Hard delete and export. ``status`` is a soft-delete flag; GDPR erasure is
  issue #29, which needs identities and message bodies to mean anything.

Four shape decisions, each argued in the PR:

1. ``Tag.name`` and ``CustomField.name`` are unique **case-insensitively**,
   stricter than SPEC's ``unique (workspace_id, name)``. A CRM where "VIP" and
   "vip" are two tags is a data-quality bug visible in the first tag picker, and
   a service-layer check for it races with itself.
2. The five typed columns on ``CustomFieldValue`` are all nullable, ``value_text``
   included. Django discourages nullable text because it creates two empty
   states — but that is the point here: NULL means "this row is not a text row",
   a different fact from "the text is empty", and it is what makes the
   exactly-one-populated check expressible at all.
3. That check **is** a ``CheckConstraint`` — the project's first. Prose would not
   do: if a writer ever put a number into ``value_text``, the condition engine
   would read ``value_number``, find NULL, and silently return the wrong set of
   contacts. A broadcast then goes to the wrong people with nothing raising
   anywhere. The database is the only place that can catch it.
4. ``Contact`` has no ``Meta.ordering``. Ordering on a model the condition
   engine filters set-wise would attach an ``ORDER BY`` to every query it builds,
   counts included, for no benefit. The list views order explicitly. The two
   join tables skip it for a sharper reason: an ``ordering`` that spans a
   relation (``["tag__name"]``) would drag a JOIN into every ``Exists()``
   subquery.

    The first audit table in the product, and it exists because erasure is the
    one act with no undo. ``delete_contact`` sets a flag and every row survives;
    this removes a person, their identities, their consent records and their
    message history outright. "It was done" has to remain answerable after the
    only evidence has been deleted, so the receipt is a row of its own rather
    than a log line.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What it deliberately does not hold
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **No name, no email, no phone.** A record that survives an erasure by
    keeping the erased person's identifiers has not erased them; it has moved
    them. :attr:`contact_id` is the whole reference — a UUID this deployment
    minted, which after the delete resolves to nothing and identifies nobody. It
    is enough to answer "was this request honoured", which is the question an
    audit is for, and not enough to reconstruct who it was about.

    ``requested_by_label`` is the exception that proves it: that is the
    *operator's* address, not the contact's. Accountability runs the other way.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two jobs, one row
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is also the queue-backed run's state, the way :class:`ContactImport` is
    for a CSV import — a large contact's erasure outlives the request that asked
    for it, so ``status`` and ``error`` are here rather than in a second table
    that would have to be kept in step with this one.

    No foreign key to ``Contact``: the row it names is gone by the time this one
    matters, and a cascade would delete exactly the record that has to survive —
    the reasoning ``apps/channels/models.py``'s ``EmailSuppression`` gives for
    the same choice.
