"""The CRM: the contact list, the contact detail page, segments and CSV
import/export — plus the tag and custom-field settings pages.

Two issues meet in this module. L2-A (#3) shipped the tag and field settings
pages finished, and a deliberately small contact list whose only job was to put
the condition engine's set-wise path in front of a human. L4-C (#13) turns that
list into the product surface and adds everything around it. The settings pages
below are the originals, extended with tag merge; **there is exactly one tag
editor in this app**, and adding a second one beside it was the named failure
mode for this issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who may do what
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading the CRM is ``@require_workspace_role(WorkspaceRole.VIEWER)`` — "is a
member of this workspace" — rather than a permission key, and that is a
considered choice. SPEC §4's table has nine keys and none of them means "may see
contacts": an Agent has ``edit_contact_fields`` and a Viewer has neither that nor
``manage_crm``, yet the issue's acceptance criteria require an Agent to edit a
contact's tags and fields and a Viewer to see the CRM read-only. Adding a tenth
key would diverge from a table the SPEC writes out in full, and reusing
``use_inbox`` would gate the Contacts page on a key that means something else.
CONTRIBUTING.md's preference for ``require_permission`` holds where the gate is a
named capability; this one is seniority, which is the case that decorator
documents itself as being for.

Writes keep using keys, and split at the line SPEC §4 already draws:

* ``edit_contact_fields`` (agent+) — edit a contact's system fields and custom
  field values, attach and detach **existing** tags, opt an identity out.
* ``manage_crm`` (editor+) — everything that changes the workspace's shape or
  moves data in bulk: creating a tag, segments, delete, import, export, starting
  and stopping automation, and the two settings pages.

Creating a tag from the detail page's typeahead is tag CRUD, so it is
``manage_crm``; *attaching* one an Agent can already see is not. The typeahead
offers its "create" affordance only to holders of the former.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conventions inherited from L2-A, still load-bearing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorator order is ``@login_required`` → ``@require_*`` → ``@require_GET``/
``@require_POST``, and the method check being innermost matters: a cross-tenant
GET must answer 404 from the middleware rather than 405 from the method guard,
which is what the IDOR sweep's "at least one method answers 404" contract relies
on.

Mutations answer :func:`apps.common.htmx.toast_response` — a 204 carrying
``HX-Trigger`` — and the affected container re-fetches itself on the event.
Failures are **also 204**, deliberately: htmx does not process ``HX-Trigger`` on
a non-2xx response by default, so answering 400 would swallow the very message
the user needs to read.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What the IDOR sweep cannot see
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``tests/idor.py`` walks URL kwargs, so every ``<uuid:…>`` below is covered
automatically once its resolver is registered. It does **not** walk the query
string, and this module puts three tenant-shaped things there: ``?segment=``,
``?filter=`` (which names tag, field and segment ids inside a JSON document) and
the bulk endpoints' ``ids``. All three are resolved through
``get_scoped_object_or_404`` or a ``.for_workspace()`` filter, and all three have
their own cross-tenant tests in ``tests/test_views.py``.
