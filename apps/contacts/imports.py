"""CSV import: parsing, the dry run, and the batched queue handler (SPEC §2, §15).

The issue's acceptance criterion is "50k-row CSV imports in background without
web-request timeouts, dry-run catches type errors, report downloadable". Three
properties fall out of that, and everything here is shaped by them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. One loop, two modes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dry run and the import are the **same code path** with ``mode`` deciding
whether :func:`_apply_row` writes. A separate validator would be a second
implementation of "what does this row mean", and the failure of a disagreement
between them is the worst kind available here: a preview that says the file is
clean and an import that then half-applies it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Batched, because a handler runs inside a transaction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``apps.queueing.worker`` runs each handler inside ``transaction.atomic()``. A
50 000-row import as one action would therefore be one transaction holding tens
of thousands of new rows, and one crash away from doing all of it again. So each
action processes :data:`~django.conf.settings.CONTACT_IMPORT_BATCH_ROWS` rows
from ``next_offset``, writes the counters, and re-schedules itself for the next
slice **in the same transaction** — so a batch and the arrangement to continue
it commit together, or neither does.

That is also what makes a crash safe: a batch that dies rolls back its rows
*and* its counter update, so the retry starts from the same ``next_offset`` and
cannot double-create.

The scheduled row deliberately carries **no contact**. ``apps.queueing.worker``
takes the contact advisory lock when one is named (SPEC §9.6's one-step-per-
contact invariant), and bulk work that holds a contact lock for the length of a
batch would stall every flow for that contact behind it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. No identity is ever fabricated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An imported contact is **not reachable on any channel**. This module never calls
``upsert_contact_identity``: a spreadsheet column is not consent, and a phone
number typed into a CRM is not a WhatsApp opt-in. The contact exists, is
segmentable and is visible in the CRM; the moment they message a connected
channel, ingest creates the identity with a real consent record (SPEC §11.8).
The consent checkbox on the upload step says exactly this, and
``ContactImport.consent_ack`` records that it was shown.

Rows go through :mod:`apps.contacts.services` one at a time rather than
``bulk_create``. That costs queries and buys two things the shortcut loses:
contract 7's ``contact.created`` / ``contact.tag_added`` events fire, and
``ContactScopedModel.save()`` derives ``workspace`` — which ``bulk_create``
skips, as ``apps/contacts/models.py`` warns in as many words.
