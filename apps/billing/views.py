"""The two POSTs: start a subscription, and manage an existing one.

Both are org-tier and gated with ``@require_org_role("admin")`` rather than a
``PERMISSION_KEYS`` entry. That is the ``apps/api/views_keys.py`` precedent
exactly — API keys are org-tier and gate the same way — and it is deliberate
rather than lazy: adding ``manage_billing`` to ``PERMISSION_KEYS`` would
propagate it into ``SCOPE_PERMISSIONS`` in ``apps/api/auth.py`` and hand every
bearer token a scope over payment operations. Nobody asked for an API that can
start a subscription.

Decorator order is the house stack — ``login_required`` outermost,
``require_POST`` innermost — so a cross-tenant GET answers 404 rather than 405,
which would confirm the route exists.

CSRF is **on** for both. The webhook is the only ``csrf_exempt`` thing in this
app, and it is exempt because Stripe holds no cookie.

Both 404 when Stripe is unconfigured. An endpoint that cannot charge anybody
should not advertise that it exists — the ``/internal/tick`` answer, and the same
reasoning ``_hub_challenge`` spells out.
