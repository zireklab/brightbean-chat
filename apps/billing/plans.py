"""The two plans, as constants rather than rows.

There is deliberately **no** ``Plan`` or ``Price`` table. Stripe holds the
prices, and a database mirror of them is a second source of truth that drifts
silently the first time somebody edits one in the dashboard — the same argument
``apps/media_library/quotas.py`` makes about denormalised counters. What lives
here is the part Stripe does not know: which limits each plan carries, and the
English a reader sees on the billing page. The price *ids* are environment
variables, because they differ between the test and live accounts.

**The numbers mirror ManyChat's free plan**, which is the brief. Read off their
pricing page rather than a summary of it: 25 active contacts a month, any two
channels, up to four active automations, one user, a basic inbox. Their older
1,000-contact tier is gone and blog posts still quoting it are describing a plan
nobody can sign up for.

Two places where a literal transcription would have been wrong, both argued in
``docs/billing.md`` rather than hidden:

* **Broadcasts are not gated.** ManyChat puts them two rungs up. Here the
  active-contact meter already bounds them by arithmetic — a free organization
  cannot reach a twenty-sixth person, whatever surface it uses to try — so a
  second gate would need its own copy, its own tests and its own downgrade
  semantics while forbidding nothing the first one allows.
* **Stored contacts are not capped.** ManyChat caps contacts you *talk to*, not
  rows you keep. Capping storage would break CSV import for exactly the person
  a free tier exists to convert.

``None`` means unlimited, everywhere in this module. Not ``0``, and not
``sys.maxsize``: a sentinel that is falsy would make ``if limit:`` silently mean
"unlimited is zero", and a very large integer would make an over-limit message
read "0 of 9223372036854775807 used".
