"""What the billing page shows, in each of the four states it has.

The state that matters most is the first one below. On a deployment with no
payment provider the page still renders — the usage figures are useful on
anybody's box — but it must **not** render a Free-versus-Pro comparison, because
on that box the Free column's limits are fiction. Showing them would be the one
thing SPEC §1.1's promise actually forbids: telling a self-hoster they are on a
restricted plan when they are not.
