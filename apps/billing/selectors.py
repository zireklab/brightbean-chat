"""What the billing page renders. The contract between billing and that page.

One function, returning a plain dict, so the page's view stays an import and a
merged dict rather than growing billing logic — and so a redesign of the page
needs no Python change at all.

The page is deliberately useful on a deployment with **no** Stripe: the usage
figures are read from the same models everything else reads, and "how many people
did we talk to this month, how many seats are in use, how many channels are
connected" is worth answering whether or not anybody is selling anything. What
the unconfigured page does not show is a plan comparison — rendering a Free
column whose limits are fiction on a box that has no limits would be the one
thing the AGPL promise actually forbids.
