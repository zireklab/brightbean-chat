"""What an organization is allowed to do, and the one line that keeps it optional.

**Read :func:`billing_enabled` first.** Everything in this module funnels through
it, and it is the promise that keeps the AGPL product whole: a deployment that
has not configured Stripe has exactly one tier, with every feature available to
every user, exactly as ``docs/SPEC.md`` §1.1 has always said. That is not a
special case sprinkled through the checks below — it is a single early return in
:func:`limits_for`, so there is one line to read to know a self-hoster is
unlimited, and one line to test.

**This module deliberately fails open, and it is the only one here that does.**
``apps.members.roles.permissions_for_role`` denies on a role it does not
recognise; ``apps.api.auth.permissions_for_scopes`` grants nothing for a scope it
does not know; both argue that guessing permissively is how a stale row becomes a
privilege escalation. That reasoning does not transfer, because there is no
privilege at stake: the resource on the other side of these checks is the
operator's own data, not another tenant's. Failing closed when configuration is
missing costs a self-hoster a working install; failing open costs a hosted
customer a free month. Those are not comparable, and the cheap one is the one
that cannot be made right by a support email.

**The gates live here as explicit functions, not in the permission system.**
Folding entitlements into ``WorkspaceMembership.effective_permissions`` would put
them on the protocol ``apps.api.auth.VirtualMembership`` implements, and the
failure runs the *opposite* way from the one that module's docstring warns about:
a plan-derived key that stopped being granted would **revoke** capability from
every API key already issued, at downgrade, with nothing on the keys page
changing to explain it. A permission answers "may this member do this"; an
entitlement answers "has this organization paid for this". They fail in opposite
directions and must not share a channel.

A decorator was the other candidate and does not fit either: four of the five
limits are counts evaluated against a *specific proposed action* — an
organization with two flows must reach the publish view and an organization with
four must not succeed at it — and three of the call sites have no view at all.
``apps/contacts/imports.py`` runs in a worker, ``send_outbound`` is a service
function, and ``accept_invitation`` is reached from an unauthenticated route.

Counting convention: every limit is counted **across the organization's
workspaces**, because a plan is bought by an organization and a limit somebody
can multiply by clicking "New workspace" is not a limit. That is affordable
precisely because the free plan also caps workspaces at one, so for the
organization that has never paid the loop below has a single iteration. The loop
is a loop rather than ``Model.objects.unscoped().filter(workspace__organization=…)``
on purpose: ``.unscoped()`` is the cross-tenant escape hatch, and the module that
decides what an organization may do is the last one that should contain an
example of it for somebody to copy.

    every gated write on a self-hosted deployment queue behind one row for a

    third-party request is how a degraded provider becomes an exhausted
    connection pool.
